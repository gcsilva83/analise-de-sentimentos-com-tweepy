I agree with the previous commenters about Internation's horrible/fradulent policy and customer service. I moved back home because of COVID so was no longer an expat. When my Albatross membership due came up I never received any notification (they will keep giving you the same response of how you could have checked on your profile page and the process is super easy). When i inform that I will no longer be needing the service a day after my membership was charged (this was promptly sent to me) I informed them that I will no longer be using the service and please either downgrade or cancel my account as now I couldn't do it from the page. After that - as the others mentioned, NON-STOP email threatening, chasing, for legal action, debt collection....IS THIS WHAT I SIGNED UP FOR THE WHOLE TIME? Yes, you can blame this all on your policy and that this is legal under German law (to I suppose threaten your customer when they've claimed they no longer wish to do business with you). What horrible practice - for jus...
It was a long time since i had not renew my internations albatross membership, because i was relocated. When i returned and paid my old time balance they gave me complimentary a 3 months membership! I do appreciate it, especially these days, that we have more the need to share, communicate, exchange feelings and ideas through the computer.
Got to realize they were collecting money without notification when the payment was rejected due to credit card expiration. Despite a direct email informing Internations I was not interested in extending the membership they keep harassing me with threatening messages. Such attitude besides being irespectful is totally unacceptable in today's world. As much as I supported the concept since its inception I believe such a business model is appalling and should be condemned. People, don't ever give away your credit card details to Mr Zeeke.
Whatever you do, make sure to give them no credit card details as they will scam you- They took payment and then wrote to me threatening legal action and demanding payment (which is what alerted me to the fact that they had as I checked my account). This company is a scam, pure and simple. I struggle to believe that the employees are able to sleep at night knowing what they are part of. Sickening.
This site is wonderful it allows you to connect with expats in your country and global minds abroad your country .. I recommend you use this app it is amazing It is a great community to gather together And it is good if you want to travel abroad so you can connect with global minds people to provide you with information and make new friends and much more 😊I can simply say this app is the best 👍
Dear Scammed Members,Thank you for submitting your feedback and for sharing your concerns with us that we don't care about, therefore we hire students to reply to each review with one of our canned answers. You probably know all of these answers already, as the mentioned issues have not been addressed since years on purpose. It was easier for us to develop boring template answers than to be fair and ethical to our members.Kindly be informed that we operate on an automatic renewal system which enables us a more convenient usage of our members' credit card data (= charging it without prior notification & not allowing them to delete this data), making sure that they do not miss out on writing negative reviews or complain about how we are unable to offer any premium features of Albatross Membership during a world pandemic & lock-down. This old trick still works well.We don't bother with informing any of our members when their Albatross Membership subscription will get renewed automatically and we charge them f...
Great to meet people from different heritage!
"I signed up for a FREE trial, unfortunately, a day after we were announced a total lockdown in Paris, therefore I was unable to profit from my membership, or use the platform for anything. Few days ago I got a pending transaction on my account - Internations is charging me 80.17 euro for THE WHOLE YEAR of membership. I thought this could be easily solved, similar like let's say ""Amazon Prime"" with who I was able to get the money back for a subscription that I was not really interested in. I locked my card and I contacted them immediately. But, to my absolute surprise, the answer was negative: ""we will not issue a refund"". I am still fighting and refuse to pay upfront for a year of subscription for something I am not even interested in. I consider this kind of ""trick"" as a highly fraudulent, and won't rest until they stop scamming people into unwanted memberships. If you are interested, contact me, together we can file a proper complaint, and expose Internations for what it really is - huge money scammer !"
I would give 0 star if I could. WORST company ever, unethical and useless customer service. Been charged for a membership I never agreed to and I can see I'm not the only one.DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR CARD DETAILS.Update after Internations replied: thanks but no thanks for your reply, you are a total fraud. Seeing the number of unsatisfied customers and you act like everything is fine, Shame on you for taking people money in such a dishonest way!!
I joined InterNations last year and upgraded to an Albatross membership for one year to try it out. I was not aware that the membership fee is set to auto renew and that there is no choice to opt out. Unlike other companies and organisations that behave ethically and send reminders to customers, InterNations did not send a reminder email that my membership would be auto renewed.  If I had known about the auto renewal with no option to opt-out, I would not have have upgraded my membership at all. The advertised benefits and terms of the membership are misleading and not made clear from the outset preying on unwary expats who are seeking assistance with settling in to their new countries of residence.  I only discovered this when InterNations recently tried to auto renew my membership and there was an issue with payment. I have since received threatening letters from InterNations that they will sell my debt to a debt collection agency. I did not expressly or knowingly agree to the auto renew or to have a fur...
I was a few hours too late to cancel after a 30 day trial. I contacted them right away, and they refused to refund. I think they only make money from people like me.  I don't see how will get any benefit from this organization at all. I googled InterNation scam and got to this page.
I am completely satisfied with InterNations.com online support. Super!
"Internations is a very useful platform particularly for new and young expats. I myself am an expat for 42 years, starting as a volunteer in development work (first in rural water supply & sanitation and later in management). My tour brought me and my family to Nepal, UK, the Netherlands, the Philippines, South Sudan, Kenya, and now I am in Bangladesh. The various Internations activities are generally pretty the same in all these countries, with regular parties, social gatherings and outings. My perception is that these activities are mainly catered for the young(er) generation of expats - (understandably, because this is the largest group of members on this platform). However, I miss at times activities or exchanges that might be interested for the more seasoned expats (and thus generally older) members. I'm thinking of possible topics and issues related to ""third-culture children"", exchange of ""cross-cultural anecdotes"" - i.e. in a light/funny way exchanging of (at times embarrassing) cross-cultural exper..."
I was very happy with the way internations handled my query about paying for services no longer being used. Thank you for your help.
"I wish I could give zero stars to this sham of an organization. All they care about is squeezing membership fees out of you, even if it means scamming people, I wonder how these scums are even allowed to thrive. I was auto-renewed for Albatross membership without a headstart. Thankfully I changed my credit cards. But these scums will haunt you with emails and threaten you with legal action if you do not pay for a service that you do not want to use any more. Their reasoning; 'your details as an Albatross member have been shared with organizers'. Excuse me, but who gives a damn about this information in 2020 when all the social events are nearly impossible????I am going to knock on every legal door I can to lodge a complaint against these scums, hope they are brought down!"
Automatic renewal of membership without warning the worst!
"These shmucks didn`t ""approve"" my membership. F UR APPROVAL - WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK U ARE?"
Internations is the worst app I've EVER used.They charge you £98 with NO WARNING!DO NOT USE THIS APP
Would be a zero star review if the system allowed. I signed up to Internations while working overseas last year. One month after the anniversary of joining I got a 'renewal reminder follow-up'. I never received any reminder ahead of the renewal - so this was already inaccurate. Their policy is to automatically renew memberships - taking payment from your card provided at signup (mine had thankfully expired). I have multiple annual payments with other organisations and without fail ALL of them act in an ethical manner and let me know before the renewal date that a payment is due. Not Internations.Despite multiple emails to them pointing out that their policy is borderline fraudulent and not in keeping with other service providers, I have only ever had generic customer service responses.Unless you really need their services I would suggest you give them a wide berth. If you do sign up, cancel your service after payment. I was told that this will mean at the one year mark you will not be charged - if it's sti...
I had a request and got an answer quickly Many than ks
If you want to get cheated. InterNations is example. They discontinued paid membership.
Unfortunately, I signed for their Albatros membership, just to give it a try (back in 2017). Then I realised that the service itself does not bring me any value and stopped using it. Recently, I realised that they have been charging me since then without my consent (they claim that once you give them your credit card details, they enrol you to an automatic renewal). When I got in touch with them and basically said the following:1)First of all, I haven't used their services for years. I don't even recall my password or credentials (and not logged in to their systems) 2) Neither I haven't been provided with any notification for renewal of the annual fees nor I have been provided with a legal invoice following membership charges 3) I have no access to the mentioned email address (within my credentials) which means that any emails they have been sending were returning a notification where they just ignored such fact for the sake of keep charging me for nothing4) Absence of my access to my registered email addr...
Never found one event that I remotely wanted to attend, but then again I am maybe shy and difficult. And now I discover I have been charged every year for a membership I thought I had paid for one year only. And to top it off I am now threatened to send my debt to a debt collector, which is not a way to treat members! And even if I want to pay my debt it is in Danish crowns, and since I do live there anymore for over 2 years, I do have danish credit cards any longer. Such a mess
Auto-charged two years in a row, requested cancelation  last year - notified them (and my credit card company) as soon as I noticed this new charge.  Reached out, and got the same response as others - given this clear and consistent violation, this seems like it might warrant a class action?
They are a terrible company with terrible customer service. They take your money even though I cancelled my subscription. I wrote to them via email and they redirected me and redirected me and redirected me.
As of October 26th 2020, London is currently in currently in Tier 2 lockdown, which means that you cannot meet others outside your family or support bubble indoors. You can meet others outside, but the rule of 6 still applies. Despite these strict rules, Internations is encouraging the organization of in person events which clearly breaks these rules. A Halloween party with more than 100 registered attendees is just one of them. This behaviour is completely reckless. I have reported Internations to the local authorities. This organization obviously only cares about collecting membership fees, and has shown a complete disregard for the safety of the public.
"This is either an outright scam, or completely unethical business practices. I've been debited $95 from my account and I don't even remember signing up for albatross membership, and would have wanted basic membership were it an option. I also haven't received any notifications that I would be charged. In trying to now cancel my ""subscription"", there isn't any clear way to do it on their website. I still can't find anywhere where their fees are advertised in advanced. I've also experimented by trying to re-join with a separate email address and they still don't make their membership fees clear.They also bombard you with unhelpful messages while you're there. This is, without a doubt, the worst networking/social website I've ever joined."
Internations Quality Assurance Team is responsive with good follow through and good follow up when Forum Guidelines are violated by members on the World Forum discussion boards. The abusive post on a political thread was removed within approx. 24 hours of the report.  Pretty good response time.
Ms Nathalie was indeed very understanding and helpful.
Internations Will Not Refund Unwanted Credit Card ChargeI have asked for a refund the same day they put the charge and while the charge was still in the pending state.
I had not cancelled my Albatross membership as I thought it was not necessary. As InterNations started sending me invoices I told that I don't want to continue as an Albatross member, but they told me I had to pay to be able to downgrade. However I explained the situation and they made an exception and cancelled my membership free of cost, so I did not have to pay for this year. Very happy about that, thank you InterNations!
"Juste ÉVITE, just AVOID !!!I didn't wait that they are many, many ""bad guy"", given ""fake news"", ...on this plateforme. I did try to communicated with 4,5 persons. All are liars. Special they have the same style, like they did go to the same school. Très mauvais ! Faites attention !"
"Like others on here, I, too, had an Albatross subscription that was ""renewed"" immediately without my knowing (during this pandemic), even though I did not have a card on file. I tried contacting their customer service, which just told me to read the Terms & Conditions - they have absolutely no empathy for people in this pandemic. They just want to take your money...and it's a significant amount for a [expletive] subscription. If they were smart and if they cared about users, they'd have a policy for the pandemic, seeing as people can't safely meet in person. I have been contacted over the past few months from Internations, who explained this is a legal contract that I have to pay. The most recent one threated to get a debt collections agency involved (mind you, I'm only a few months overdue...)This is an absolutely horrible company. Disgusting. I hope it goes down due to everyone cancelling and never coming back. And reading these reviews here before joining - I HOPE!"
InterNations administration didn't respect members and didn't respond to solve members problemsReally so bad experience with them
Well. Like everything else a organization is as good as the people they run it or attending it. I can only talk about Panama City Panama where I joint. Be very carefully with ladies looking for your best ->money! There are 4 kind of people attending: 1 business people 2nd prostitutes 3rd looking to sell services 4th people for a drink and dancing. I’m at number 4th. But you cannot avoid the 1st three kind of people. Means from my lost money: Do NOT trust anyone who you don’t know and if you think you know the person do NOT trust that person at all. That’s my advice for any event with Internations.org!
Paid for a subscription to this website while I was traveling, looking for some meetups and to meet some other travelers. Thought nothing of it. It was a relatively nice experienceIn 2019, after my subscription ran out. I wasn't allowed to access the content again until I paid to renew my subscription. That seems fair. I still wanted to use the content so I paid.I barely used the website since then and when they repeatedly told me my subscription was going to end, I didn't care, because I no longer wanted to use the product in 2020 with the pandemic. Anyway, without my permission, they extended my subscription and sent me a ridiculous email, trying to threaten me and saying I owed them money, even though I had no current credit card in their system. That's not how things work. You cut off someone's access to content when they don't pay. Seems they got extra sketchy during the Corona pandemic and just started trying to hustle people. Sounds like a criminal to meNow they are basically trying to extort me for...
Avoid at all cost! Awful site and not helpful customer service. Absolutely useless.... waste of money!
I got court into paying from my paypal account account. I didn't see the small writing. When I realised it was too late and couldn't get my money back even though i never used it. I thought everything happens for a raison so I try to keep up with the events. At the end I have participated to only a red carpet event which was average got approached by many guys like it's a dating site. Really disappointed, not for me.
You can already see how they deal with customers by seeing their answers only to positive comments. It says a lot about them. I am glad I didn't have enough money on my card, so they may postpone my membership as long as they want. Just send them an official letter saying that you don't want it, to protect your rights. After that it is up to them.
They don't let you cancel the subscription!! and take from your account 95 euros before you notice. they are really a scam!! be aware!
"It is with regret, I have been forced to write this review. InterNations promises to be a place of personal  safety regretfully I have found this not to be the case.Wanting to make a contribution to the InterNations values and vision of, I made a series of Empowering evidence based presentations.Like other presenters before me I used my own  links   and a required registration on Eventbrite.The registration of Eventbrite was to ensure safety due to past experiences of unwarranted behaviour and other professional concerns  Even then, I noted  individuals who had not registered on the interNations site were present let in by the host. These professional and safety concerns were discussed before and after the presentations  with the respective hosts on more than one occasion.Eventually, this  led me to the decision  not to make any further presentations. In a short space of time after this announcement I received a warning  message from the InterNations ""Community Integrity Team"" based on reports they receive..."
"InterNations has a very unpleasant and unethical system : Albatross membership automatic renewal system. A huge number of members are forced to pay annual fee without being asked their intention to renew it. In many countries automatic renewal system is prohibited by the local law but this organization founded in Germany is ignoring each country's law shamelessly, imposing German law to all the members in the world, explaining that the members all over the world must obey to their General Terms & Conditions based on the German law. This is really absurd and insane. Since when has Germany become the commander of the world? As they are expanding their activities abroad, they have the obligation to respect each nation's law, yet they are breaking it with "" we don't care at all "" attitude, besides they threaten the members who object forced payment, saying that they will use their debt collection agent to take money. This is a typical mafia's attitude. At least 5 of my friends who are currently Albatross membe..."
Auto-renewal without prior notice and reminder. I have not used or attended any of their events, yet there is no possibility to cancel or get refunded. Avoid at all cost!!
Actually my account was rejected so i am unable to give review
I  was shocked to find 95€  debited from my bank account.  Internations renewed my membership without my having authorized it.When I got a new credit card last year, Internations sent me countless emails asking me to pay my membership fee.  When I did not respond, they threatened legal action.Strange how they are less responsive when it comes to giving me a refund.
The Customer experience at Internations is just WOW, immediate action & prompt replies. Its amazing to be a part of this Wonderful organization.Alee Allana.
This service might be interesting for some people but they conduct their business in a very shady way. They give you one month free but they make you provide your billing information. Then they don't send you any alert and when you forget to downgrade they take 80€ from your account, even if you didn't use the service at all!I tried to contact both them and paypal but I couldn't get any refund. Even though I've basically never used the platform at all!
I'm leaving internations because of the very bad conversation here. No one is waiting for you if you are some minutes late like in the hike group today. In some groups, you even have to apply multiple times through different channels e.g. the Kung Fu or bachata activity. Extremely difficult. It doesn't seem to me as a welcome culture at all. If were a host, I would'nt treat my members like that.
null
This app is terrible. An absolute waste of time and in addition they do their best to rip you off once you signed up.
I have enjoyed being on InterNations. As an emigrant it’s really nice to connect with people from my home country. I have met lovely people on this site! It is professional and fun too! They make an effort with events for networking which is really great!
It is basically a scam, all 5* reviews are clearly fake accounts created by them.
In terms of payment i never had any issues at all. Used them for 3 years without issues however my own experience in the London group was racism. In a meeting of over 2000 people i could not make one good friend. I kept wondering why this was happening till the day a Russian person as well as Greek guy in the group told me “not everyone likes blacks “. The London group is dominated by italian men looking for innocent victims to sleep with and dump after. So many women were victims of this  and before we knew if they turned it to a sex group. I was relieved to have left as i was almost becoming an alcoholic there. Internations London is not for the faint hearted.
I have been a member for many years and am very happy with the services provided.  Lots of activities in many areas of interest and frequent updates keep me informed and enthusiastic to know what's going on. The only suggestion I have is that internationas to provide facilities or arrangements with language schools to assist expats to learn the local language (e.g. I live in Vietnam and want to learn Vietnamese). It will help a lot if Internations would provide such a service.
Internations is an outright unethical company. Auto subscription is ridiculous. They send notice threatening legal action after renewing subscription without explicit consent or reminder. Happened to me two years in a row. Never resubscribing to the paid membership again!! I urge everyone to register your complaint with consumer rights protection bodies in your respective countries and in Germany. This company fails to understand that having a fine print with dodgy terms also means the company is dodgy. Let’s be serious, who reads the fine print unless it is an important life/investment decision! Traditional default opt-in vs opt-out mechanisms are well understood and accepted across tech industry and pulling the ‘our subscription policy’ card is a joke to say the least. Please also note most 5* reviews here have been marked as ‘invited’ which means the company manually sent the review link to users they chose to send the links to! If you look at review details this company has 90% 1* ratings and 4% 5* rat...
Today I filed a claim with the Canadian Better Business Bureau about their predatory practices and behavior.  Apparently, I was not the first.It's sad because the people I met locally are all good but the billing and management structure of the mother ship is poor.
Thieves behavior. Crooks. Trying to find a way to drag them to court. Paid three months membership I never got.
During COVID-19, InterNations is unable to provide the in-person networking events for which I not only joined it, but also paid the Albatross Membership (whose main benefit is to cover the attendance fees for those in-person events). With COVID-19, the Albatross membership offers no advantages and so I would not be renewing it if I were given the choice. Because I don't want to attend yet more online events I haven't been visiting the InterNations website when invited to do so from the many emails they send for this. I was very annoyed to see that in late June I was billed for a renewal of the Albatross membership, even though I never received any email reminding me it was coming up. I complained to InterNations and was told that they don't send out reminder emails (despite their ability to constantly send out invitations to online events), that I should have seen the reminder on the website that I never visit, and that they would not refund me the fee. I had multiple email conversations where they repeat...
Worst headquarter management team that is ridiculously greedy and inhumane. I, along with many other members, got automatically charged a ridiculous amount without any prior warning in the middle of a pandemic. This happened to members who lost their jobs during the pandemic. When I vocalized my views, InterNations resorted to censorship by removing my post in the local forum. When you have tens of thousands of people around the world boycotting you online, it tells you something. The management team simply refuses to listen to members and local organizers (who by the way don't get paid but organize local events for InterNations as free labor). Terrible for-profit company that pretends to be non-profit. Be aware!
Internations is the best ever experience that i have seen being abroad. They exceeded every expectation in its services and connected many people abroad.They have been very consistent over 13 years and their model is fair and simple. I highly recommend this website as it offers ex-pat a safe place. Kind regards. Miro
Hello & AOA!InterNations is one of the world's best opportunity for Foreign Expats, Global minds and Likewise minded educated people. Do not boycott at all. We have been attached to InterNations for so many years and we have seen No Scams, No bad things or No bad people can stay at this wonderful Organisation.Please do not believe on the few who are spreading misconceptions about tremendous organisation.If there were anything bad seen by us I would be the first who left this organisation and writing negative over here. The fact that nothing bad is possible in InterNations as it's an international repute organisation of Germany and there are the most educated, intellectual and intelligent people are assigned to control it. I can not even think of it that this is Scam. So please avoid few bad people who may want to become famous through cheap way of projecting an International repute dynamic and prestigious organisation wrongly.Do not boycott InterNations at all.All that are spreading misconceptions are just...
Tried to cancel my contract - it broke my heart as I found a lot of nice people at InterNations but times are tough at the moment so I had to cancel, It  was not easy in the beginning to find out what to do so I contacted  Lara in Munich who was such a great help. Do not listen to all these negative comments  It always depends how you communicate ...Thank you for all active members doing a great job!Nina
Scam. They charged the membership without reminder. Would NOT recommend them.
I had a problem of being a member of the internation club so i wrote to the cusomers support They answered to me immediatelly they helped me do want i want and their service was exquisit Well done to this company and their employees
"I am brazilian and lived abroad many times because of my job. Now I am in Brazil and I decided to move to Spain in two years, after my retirement.

When I found the InterNations site I wondered if I could meet other brazilians that crossed the same path I will do, then I decided to request my membership.I filled in the form and my request was declined.

DO NOT GET INVOLVED WITH THESE FOLKS UNLESS  YOU WANT TO BE HELD HOSTAGE TO THEIR MAILINGS FOREVER.  I reached out to this organization two years ago when I was looking to invite one of their local groups to attend an international film screening. That one contact got me on multiple mailing lists. I have tried -- and I have been using the internet for over 30 years so this is not my first rodeo-- to get off their mailing lists. Repeatedly. Over and over. But, they are relentless. They make it impossible to unsubscribe.If you know they are an organization you want to join FOR LIFE go for it. Otherwise: do.not.give.them.your.email.address!!!
Great community you can meet people from all over the world!
"I emailed the customer care asking them to cancel my membership in june , but they did not cancel and they are still sending me payment links in August, utterly bad experience. My support ticket number was 182123.Also let me tell you all the events and gathering are below par, not useful at all, dont ever enrol.You will not be able to opt out and they will keep extracting your money illegally.The website FAQ describing how to cancel membership is always throwing ""page not found"" error, buggy website and app when you try to cancel your membership."
#InterNations threatens users.This is a #mismanaged #company that threatens #users with #legal #action when #members can't pay their #dues due to #economical #difficulty especially during the #pandemic (#covid19). I would #advise #everyone planning to #join this #platform to stay away. I #hope #internations #gets #audited & #investigated by #EU & #Germany.
I inadvertently ended up signing up for a paid membership when a friend had asked me to sign up to show I was attending her event.  It was a mistake on my part.  I am very careful usually and quite good at spotting ways companies try to trick you into parting with money.  It was only a month later or so that I noticed in my bank account a debit of what turned out to be not one month but a year's membership.  I requested reimbursement which was refused on the grounds that it was clear enough.  A year on, and I am being sent invoices for another year's membership and my emails to protest them have gone unanswered.  This is a cowboy-like way of doing business and totally unacceptable. Watch out!  It happened all too easily.  I sincerely hope the BBC to whom I have just written will investigate.I notice now that Internations are responding to complaints here.  So here's a message for you Internations - I am not in the slightest bit interested in the robot-like responses I have just been reading since first sub...
So, I will be another soon to be ex member complaining about the mafia membership options. This organization is a joke. I cancelled my membership the past two years and every year it shows that I didn’t and their records conveniently show no record of my cancellation. Then they will refuse refunds. It’s seriously like the mafia once you get in you can’t get out. Then they will respond to your reviews with some sickly sweet reply with how much they want to help. They care less about their organization than scraping funds from unsuspecting consumers. Disregard their response, since the leadership of this company has no idea what it means to engage customers. They only care about money.
I don't know if the internet was stable enough for you to receive the following review, so here it is.You want a review? Ok here it is: InterNations gives me a more balanced view on the realities of life. That's when I can get online from Kabul - and of course when we have power. But during those fleeting moments when I can take a peek into other peoples lives, opinions, likes, dislikes, comments, I am transported into a world not filled with abductions, shooting, bombings etc, which are the daily diet of reports, warnings and alerts which are part of my life. In some ways, in many ways, InterNations provides me with some comfort in knowing that there is a reality outside this place that doesn't include the need for constant vigilance against the threat of violence,And having said that, there many, many good local people here who don't have that avenue or conduit to sanity. For them, there is only poverty and a struggle to survive in the face of overwhelming adversity.On a daily basis, I see many good thin...
I live in the Sathon area of Bangkok. I was placed in another community which also had a Sathon. In making a request for a change of community I was met with graciousness and hospitality. I was privileged  to receive the transfer request very competently and with rapidity.Thank You, Merlyn
If you opt to sign on with this organization after reading the reviews, be very careful about which membership you sign on for. Only the “Basic” membership is free. If you engage in some other part of their site you will be upgraded and charged about $51 USD every few months. I’ve never used this service, I looked at it once and I’ve lost over $100 because I wasn’t careful. I’m not even sure what they do is beneficial on any level to anyone except them. I think it borders on scam.
Internations contacted me via automated email about my membership payment being due. When I responded, asking to cancel membership since I havent logged in in months and can't afford membership during these times, they refused to help. They make it impossible to do this simple task. They're greedily unable to help with anything other than take your money. No empathy. All they have to do is cancel the membership. They state you have to pay it no matter what and then log in to downgrade your account in order to avoid future charges. This is why I wouldn't recommend this organization to anyone. Terrible and cold customer service and no way to opt out, even when many of us lost our jobs for 2-3 months and are still not able to work full time.
The Customer Service people are fantastic.  I had a credit for one event and that event didn’t happen due to technical issues.  Within 24 hours of my writing asking if they could extend the credit, they wrote back and extended my membership for an entire month!  Quick, efficient and terrific.
Very very poor customer service. During the COVID 19 lockdown offered no refund to subscriptions when events cancelled. Care more about profit than service. Do not use and do not recommend to anyone.
Absolutely awful company to deal with. Total lack of flexibility and empathy - Do not use.
I was very happy with the assistance of the Support team. Very timely and detailed information for the steps I had to take.Thank you so much!
Internations take the business of welcoming newcomers to a town or country very seriously, which is very useful for those arriving for the first time if they are unsure how to meet people and where to start exploring their new surroundings and culture.Internations provides a community support network from the minute you sign up.Although it was not relevant to me in this context, since I already know the town I signed up to and am interested in linking with communities abroad, I will happily use their services in the future.
I would have never thought that I would write a review about a company here. First, I want to mention that the people that organize and plan the events are nice and well-deserving people. HOWEVER, the people in charge of billing and auto-renewal services ARE GARBAGE. They only care about your money and if you notify them for a refund the day after you were charged (OHH AND BTW THERE IS NO WARNING BEFORE YOUR CHARGE), they will point out the fine print on how they cannot pay you back. I will NEVER use their services or have anybody from my network work with them in the future. No sympathy during COVID where there are NO EVENTS, but they still charge your wallet as if they are on a black Friday sale.
Internations is an awesome multi-national community. My last experience with the team of internations because of a membership's problem was very proffesional, flexible and without any delay with answers and actions.
InterNations has horrible customer service, no empathy, or accommodation at all, rather they will point out the fine print of their contract to you.While every other company on earth is trying to keep customers during this rough time, InterNations opts to keep your money instead of your membership.To make matters worse, they sent a satisfaction survey Friday, but by Monday when I wanted to leave feedback, the link had expired.  In other words they are not only fine with losing customers, but also do not care to know why. Oiweh!
If I could put zero I would! VERY BAD experience here in France. The organisation of parties, activities are horrible, places chosen are not good at all, on events we are too many people in a same room, we pay a lot for nothing! Besides, they don't even send a reminder for end of membership. Some people have seen their credit card debited, without any reminder. And if your credit card you registered  has expired, they keep harrassing you and threaten you. RUN AWAY!
Nathalie was kind and professional. She helped me to resolve the issue quickly.
i want to remove my membership from here
I took out a free trial in March 2020. Due to the pandemic and because of events being cancelled I downgraded my membership. I got deducted membership fees until July 2020 and I contacted the support team and they said they cannot refund as it is company policy. Internations cannot provide the service they are charging people for due to the pandemic and events were being held virtually. I believe that the service is also unethical as they are charging people for a service they cannot presently deliver. I notice that their response on here is just to refer people back to their support team but they just repeat they cannot refund due to customer policy. I would recommend people stay away from this website.
First of all, I have no sympathy for people complaining about being automatically renewed.  Almost everything I use works on this basis and I have no problem with it.  So to everyone complaining about the auto-renew, you should have been keeping more of an eye on your finances.  The real problem with InterNations is that it is so crap.  It is so bad I honestly can not believe it is still going.  Not worth the money at all, even before this whole Covid-19 crisis when they understandably cancelled everything.  I was a paying Albatross member for over 2 years and the events are just getting worse and worse.  You go along to an event with over 400 people signed up to it expecting to have a great time meeting new people and making friends, and you are lucky if there are 50 people there at any one time. The event hosts are a mixed bag, there does not seem to be any standard at all to the various InterNations volunteers that organise their events. I don't blame them for this though, it is InterNations who are res...
"I had an Albatross membership that was auto-renewed without prior notification in April 2020 - during a world pandemic and lock-down when there were no real-life events organized at all. (Earlier I attended a couple of events - the last one in December, so I cannot say I was very active.)  They could not charge my credit card and therefore started to harass me in email for the membership subscription fee.  I contacted them right after receiving the first email about the failed transaction for auto-renewal (otherwise I would probably have not noticed immediately that my money has gone to their pockets). The communication with their ""Support Team"" clearly showed how much consideration and empathy they have for their users (hint: 0) and how they are not willing to make an effort to provide any solution beyond canned answers. The membership that I was able to use since the coronavirus has been spreading corresponded only to Basic membership, therefore as they failed to provide any services that match the Albat..."
It used to be great... Back in 2010-2015 when I was living as an expat, lots of great activities arranged, many people attending, not too expensive to pay on the night with a free drink and snacks included. Met lots of people... Made lots of friends. Socialised. Connected.But...Now you can only attend or join most groups and activities if you are an albatross member. Absolute rubbish. And there's hardly any events being hosted. So you pay an extortionate amount for basically nothing. And you can't even join basic groups without monthly payment or membership. I've been on it again for 8 months now. Not been to any events. Tried to join a couple of groups but couldn't because I wouldn't pay membership. Most of my friends have left it now. I'll do the same. Don't recommend. Waste of time unfortunately. I miss how it was.
I  was an albatross member for the last three years and just downgraded to regular membership since I saw no added-value in the albatross level anymore.The point is: if there are almost no activities/events in your city....why paying for it?Another annoying point: I organised an art event and all my friends with basic membership where not even able to sign up for it. They would have had to upgrade to albatross membership. That means: I had all the work in organising the event and enrich the InterNations network, but was not even able to reach my friends.We all moved now to Facebook and meetup platform.Honestly, I see a steady decline in the quality of this Internations social network.

I seems to be one of many people who was charged during Covid 19, despite emailing them that we could not use the service, and I did not subscribe to auto renewals, the company took my money and would not give me a refund, even after several emails. Stay away. There are much better apps like Meetup which offer opportunities to meet new people in your new neighbourhood without giving your money to these bunch of weasels. Unfortunately women also seem to get hassled by men on this platform (often more than double my age) who seem to have confused it for a dating app. Customer service team (Dani and Nathalie) refused to give me a refund after several emails. Avoid, avoid, avoid!
Internations Europe ( Switzerland ) is pure scam organization targeting naive and desperate expatriates lacking friends and relationships , they offer 30 days free trial while asking for your credit card , while not extending past trial , they still charge the credit card without permission . Furthermore consuls taking members to most expensive places in town while acting as commissional agents .
"I was not aware of your rules- human error was the reason. I should have been notified before being kicked out.I subscribe to the value of innocent until proven guilty. Many nations  have not reached this level of civilization andwould have proceed just as your organization treated my case.    I would assume you are practicing your liberal values. "" Love me Love I am a Liberal shouted the judge """
STAY AWAY! The Auto-renewal process is a SCAM for the lack of a better word.It is an exploitation of the legal system as they will say you signed up for it after having read their terms and conditions. So you are stuck. I contacted the European Consumer Contact Network and their advise was ' You can try to argue that this is an unfair term, but ultimately only a judge in court can make this decision. '. I hope someone can be bothered enough to go this far. if needed I can assist and provide more information.They successfully took payment for two years membership from me, although I only attended one of their events after a friend told me about them.The event I attended was actually very rubbish. There was no organisation and I absolutely did not feel like I attended as a member of internations. I could have just walked into a random bar by myself. There are better ways of meeting people online that would not cost you so much money and threats of court actions for something you should be able to easily opt ...
I  have had a great experience with Internations.  One of the benefits is travelling abroad and being able to attend Members events there with other professionals. This has allowed me to meet people with similar hobbies and to speak with people interested in multiple languages like myself. Another benefit is being able to attend online events in other countries during the pandemic.P.S. I am an Albatross member, which renews automatically with my C/C. The Organisation has never tried to ‘get more money’ from me or my account.
A 0 starts. I signed up for the free service and used it maybe half a dozen times. Then 14 months later get a bill saying I owe $60. I argue that I never upgraded and never use the site. They say I upgraded May 2019 yet I didnt get a bill until July 2020. Pretty fishy. I told them to go ahead and cancel my account..they said they are unable to until I pay my outstanding balance and keep pushing me to sign into my account. I know I never got on there between May 2019 and July 2020 but they insist I must pay the $60. Mind you, whatever upgrade service they say I signed up for gives you access to exclusive events and things in the country you moved to....I DONT EVEN LIVE THERE. I dont need it, didnt need it, wont use it so what possible reason would I have for upgrading? I agree with other users...scam to get money.As seen below, company claims I upgraded the account.  I notified them on many occasions that I would have no reason to do that.  If I had, they might have my correct credit card information, but t...
This app doesn't have an option to delete messages. So sad.
Report about spam message was made to admin and it was addressed promptly. I entreat admin to address promptly other issues such as membership fees payment and refund during the COVID crisis.
Where are the 0 Stars, they are a shame. This is the second time they try to steal my money, they've done that last year and I realized that they never let me know about the automatic renewal but they let you know about every useless event but fine I paid the bill and right away took the automatic renewal so I wouldn't have the same issues later on.Despite doing it, yet here they come again asking me to pay and say they will sue me, I am 100% sure that I took of the automatic renewal yet they still want to charge me, I went back and forth with them even requested to delete my account I really can't deal with dishonest and scam business practices, which they haven't done of course they just want to get my money, I don't care they can try to sue me I will be the one using them, its a pity I did meet some nice people I was a welcome buddy and active in the community, recommend many people always praised them on Berlin Facebook groups, some of them I am an admin and know the admins, but now I will let everyone...
Internations is a scam as stated by so many people on this site and around the internet.  DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR CREDIT CARD INFO.  They will take your cc, and  if you do not cancel within 14 days of signing up, they will not let you downgrade to a free account unless you pay them the 84$ membership fee. They make money off of people who do not understand this unfair business practice until it is too late. 84% of the 384 reviewers on this site alone have complained about the same thing (and that's just a small sample of the people who have been harmed)!  If you raise this issue, or the lack of transparency/notice in their policies, to their membership services or customer service they will threaten to submit your name to a debt collection agency. If you do a google search of Internations you will find that they are not a reputable organization.  Their canned responses (which I'm sure they will post soon) and repeated threats to report any member to credit agencies who refuse to rejoin under duress, or raise...
Just awful. Dont join. You sign up for the trial and they just keep invoicing you without notification, and then make it super hard to cancel. Its actually bit of a scam. They aren't transparent at all. I went to the free introduction and realized its not for me. They kept charging me two years later, even after i didn't attend a single event, threatening legal action. Basically Scientology for expat networking.
I am revising my review downward to zero stars. Read ALL the negative reviews here and ratings. You will see they are crooks. They hold you hostage with the threat of continuing to renew your subscription if you do not pay up first in order to cancel your subscription. All the while knowing you don't want their services. They also threaten to send you to a debt collector. That service will cost them more than the subscription price. They are real scum. Avoid at ALL COSTS. You have been warned.
They do real effort of keeping the platform safe and friendly environment.
I want to put 0 Stars, to this Miserable company. They STEAL your money from your card without autorisation, The WORST I have joined. They got my money and didn't get back to me. Please Don't Join them, It's a SCAM, they don't have any customer service. And the website is designed for not letting you change your membership, totally hidden. They just want your Money, ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE! DON'T JOIN THEM!
To echo everything that has been mentioned below:1. Absolutely no value to being a member, at least where I am based.2. Automatically charging your paid membership without a reminder (which is so easy to set up, given that they say they rely on an automatic system. But why would they? :) ) In case your payment method has expired, they block your access, but still demand you pay, even if you state in writing you wish to cancel and have not received the service they try to charge for. They literally tell you: pay for a year if you wish to cancel.3. Unethical as they are, these practices appear absolutely outrageous in the light of how many people lost their income during the pandemic. But I guess Internations haven't heard about COVID-19 and the new reality...4. Will send you emails threatening to sell your debt to collectors under the German law. Way to build rapport with your customer!I am in the USA and will be filing a claim against them  with BBB and the international online businesses division of the F...
My membership was renewed for 1 year without notice, whereas I barely use the services, especially with 3 months of confinment due to Covid sanitary crisis!And it is very difficult to know how to unsubscribe on the site (and not at all on the app).I will try to get the money back through my bank but this is really a bad experience.
They will do anything to charge you after you attempt to cancel your subscription. They DO NOT follow rules and will attempt to get this money in any way possible, going as far as barring you from unsubscribing or charging you anyway. If I had to take a guess, they are probably going bankrupt and are using this as a last ditch effort to make some kind of money. Do not join and if they attempt to charge you, simply do not pay and wait for them to go bankrupt.
"Their charging methods are totally unacceptable. And don't think it only happens to new members! As a consul (event arranger) for a few years I decided to step down. Being aware of issues with recurring charging I clearly and directly requested to be restored to basic (non-paying) membership. My membership was instead changed to paying membership (one month free of charge) with automatic charging and renewal enabled. Not what I asked for.Instructions for downgrading are easily misinterpreted. Quote:""If you would like to downgrade to Basic Membership (once your premium membership expires)""Users cannot downgrade ""once premium membership expires"" because it automatically renews and incurs a charge. The wording here is deliberately vague, an honest company would clearly state that downgrade MUST happen before premium membership expiry.There's lots of negative feeling about this and that's understandable. Behave like a scam site and you should expect to receive the same amount of trust and respect. Best avoided..."
Hello everyone,I signed for a 3 month Albatross membership and offcourse Internations renew it but they just couldnt take the money from me because I only paid for 3 months and not for automatic renewal. They just send me the bill to pay, is there any way to protect myself from them forcing me to pay having in mind their tricky ways to get away with peoples money?Appreciate your comments, thank you!
This is a very unethical and dishonest organization that feeds off unsuspecting professionals who have experienced their sleazy operations and dont want to continue any longer. They automatically without consent renew the membership and then throw the rulebook. They just charged me AED 468 which is like Euros 125 without my consent. I wrote to them within an hour but they refuse to refund the charges. If someone knows of a fair-practice organization or watch-dog body in Germany or the EU, please let me know. I want everyone in Dubai to know that these guys are cheats and we must stay as far away as possible. They are getting away with this dishonest practice and hope some governmental organization clamps down on them.
Be very careful!! They never send out reminders about your membership auto-renewing and once it does, even if you immediately tell them you want to downgrade, all they will do is send you a canned response saying they won't refund anything. They should be shut down!
DO NOT sign up with Internations!! Horrible customer service and thieves. I was charged 2 years in a row after requesting they cancel my membership. They respond with “unfortunately we cannot refund you...”They make cancelling your membership e freely complicated. You would think you can cancel your membership under the “membership” button, but you cannot. It’s located someplace totally unrelated to your membership. I had to Google where to find it!!They respond 1 week later and don’t make any effort whatsoever to understand and be fair. All they care about is taking your money. You can tell their reputation from the amount of negative reviews they have, I’m surprised they’re still in business. Do not sign up with them, you will regret it!
Better way of communication with HQ is needed to enhance both the activities and the network.

I got an Albatross Membership with them in Prague and found the events lacking, and the people in them not very interesting (though that part is not InterNation's fault). Due to this, I stopped using my membership and was planning on letting it expire, however these people keep on threatening me with sending debt collectors if I don't pay their renewal.I don't want your service, I haven't used it for a year. STOP BOTHERING ME.Edit: as a reply to Internation's reply, this is due to the harrassment you practice when attempting to collect your renewal. If a credit card information isn't on your customer's profile, no use of the service happened, then it would be reasonable to leave the customer alone. But no, instead you attempt to get your renewal whatever may come, in the middle of a pandemic and are willing to damage your user's credit rating as well as have them be harassed by credit debt collectors. You are an unethical company.
false profilesrequest for money by fake profilesI'm tired of only receiving contact requests from people hiding under stolen photos and ultimately asking for money.INTERNATION must better control its members.
Fraudulent company that will not let you stop any paid or trial membership. Will threaten debt collectors if you block your card or try to downgrade your membership. Avoid at all costs.
Beware of the auto renewal policy each year for a very expensive and not value for money service. Despite making it very clear last time that I don’t use the service they will use the terms of conditions until you delete your account you are not safe. Very sly way of doing business and threatening emails until you pay. No respite until you pay. Please be very very careful! They have been deleting all negative reviews... and to be honest it looks like the positive reviews are also created by themselves. The number of deleted reviews should give you an indication of how unhappy people are. Please be very careful. One day justice will be served. The stars have gone up to two stars because internations will keep deleting negative reviews. And I don’t expect mine to stay on but I will keep posting it.
My request to join was declined with no explanation. Don't recommend.
Very bad experience with their support department. I wished to end my subscription but they refused and kept telling me that I have to pay one year fee before being able to be removed. I never asked in the first place to have my subscription renewed automatically. Their policy is misleading. They are totally uncommercial. Most probably bad managers at the top of the company.I STRONGLY advise not to register on their platform !!!
I do not like the administration of this company as it ensures it claims subscriptions quickly without reminders and has a very very long list of TERMS WHICH ARE OVER LEGAL TO PROTECT THEIR EXTRACTION OF MONIES
Internations really helped me make friends and find my feet when I moved to India - not sure how would have settled in without it!Whenever I move somewhere new, I always look on Internations first :)
It was very helpful resource while I was on the move. Good tool to meet the people who share the same interests and values.
The alternative InterNations has implemented is genius! I would call it an impeccable recovery. Online activities not only filled up my time but gave me a lot of experiences. I was lucky enough to meet some of the members on the platform and call them friends. It must’ve been hard working up a way to compensate for the temporary loss of in person interactions and events. I appreciate their innovation and persistent hard work to keep us satisfied!
Same story, I did not use their platform, and totally forgot about their existence. They took money out of my account. So, I had to stick with them for on year when I did not use them. I cancelled the auto-renewal (or so I thought) and lost my credit card, so when they tried to take some money out, obviously it was denied. They sent me emails and emails to pay and I am refusing this time year. The renewal cancellation is not clear and difficult.  Total scammers!  You are better off ASW
Horrible autorenewal process.If you did not use their useless Platform for 1 year, no reminder email for the renewal is sent and just charged to renew you for another.Totally unethical business concept! Dont subscribe to these scammer!
"Its taken me over 12 months to cancel my membership with this group. The experience has been stressful, they are one of the most disreputable companies I have dealt with.I took a trial period Albatross membership and ended up owing them 26.00E, I have had emails threatening to take me to court etc etc, and the list goes on. (for 26.00E really!!! the court cost would be much more, so that didn't bother me)Reluctantly, I paid the amount and cancelled my membership just to finalise any occasion with them.""Fine print"" ask InterNations to explain that term, exploration is exactly what it is.Greed greed, oh well, many other members may withdraw also with the Coronvirus preventing any gathering and international travel-  Karma User's recommendation: 00."
Do not pay for membership. They will lock you into automatic pay and threaten you with debt collection companies.
Horrible auto- renewal process when i was a day late to cancel my membership which only happened after the invoice was sent.
Total scam, I requested to downgrade my account as this isn’t an option on the app to do so which seems somewhat intentional. I noticed then last week they charged me for another three months their customer services say this is in line with their t&cs iv researched based on German consumer law it is not. I can see that many have similar problems with them would be good to form a collective legal action against Internations
I had Albatross membership for some years, and I did not use my account almost whole of last year due to my health problems and pregnancy. Then I received an email on the 5th of February saying that my yearly subscription is renewed but they could not get the money from my credit card. Then on the same day, which is again on the 5th of February, I answered the email and indicated that I am not interested in the Albatross membership in this year and I explained the situation over and over. Even I offerred to pay a daily or monthly payment instead of paying the yearly amount. What happenned? They said my membership is already renewed and I was late to cancel it so I have to pay. Yes, I was late but only few hours.Well, long story short, this is a horrible approach that a company can take.
Interesting to see that others have also experienced them same as I have. I can only confirm the bad experience and hope others read this before paying 83€ for nothing. I was a Basic member before, but didn't have access to any of the features. You have to be an Albatross to have access, and then you have to have time to check out the activities.Last year, I decided, I'd give it a try. Unfortunately, all the mails went to my Social Inbox, which I don't check often, and I didn't think of checking Internations often. Mostly, I got spam there.The next thing I knew was that the contract had AUTOMATICALLY been prolonged without any sort of warning except on the website itself. No mail. This is definitely not a fair business.It is making profit out of the fact that people come to a strange country feeling lonely and want to reach out to other expats. A platform shouldn't cost so much just for that. InterNations isn't offering any special features, just the option of finding contacts with similar interests. Not a...
Beware of auto-renewal for Membership!!! DO NOT JOIN!I signed up as I was in a new city thinking that it would be fun. Little did I know that this service is not what it makes it out to be, it is a SCAM! I hadn't signed on in a long time and they renewed my membership without sending any notification! And because I didn't have an updated credit card, they are now harassing me and threatening me with payment. BEWARE OF THE FOLLOWING:If you sign up for an Albatross trial, it will transfer you to an annual membership structure. I was never sent any e-mail letting me know about this and nor did I agree to this. I didn't even know that it was going to auto-renew and received an email saying my payment didn't go through and I was wondering what it was since I hadn't logged on in a long time nor received any email about the renewal. In the past few weeks, I have been emailing with Internations over the failed paymed asking if they can just cancel my membership since I haven't used it and there response is that yo...
I have been getting threats also ... answered each and every one of them saying that I had only signed up for 1 year. Internations' reaction was to send me more threats without an explanation. I went onto my Internations' page and it was blocked, forcing me to pay for another year in order to have access to my page, which I needed to see how to get out of the Albatross membership scam, since Internation never answered my e-mails explaining what the problem was and providing a solution. I still haven't figured out how to quit my membership since the FAQ have an explanation that is hard, or impossible, to follow!! Quite a SCAM!!
"Beware of auto-renewal for Membership!!!The events can be okay, depending on the city you are in.BEWARE OF THE FOLLOWING: If you sign up for an Albatross trial, it will transfer you to an annual membership structure. Each year, it will renew you automatically without any courtesy notification that the renewal is forthcoming. They say that this is for the ""convenience of their members"" however any legitimate business sends a courtesy email for the convenience of their subscribers (key word: ""courtesy""). I obtained a new credit card prior to my term expiring and  intentionally did not renew my payment info with Internations. It turns out that when they tried to automatically bill me for a second year, the payment did not go through. Over the past several months, while the world is dealing with COVID and economic shock, I've received notifications (which ultimately became threatening in nature) to renew. The most recent one I received said that i need to renew IMMEDIATELY or they will send my case to a collec..."
FRAUD ALARMI was using 30 days free trial, which gave the option to downgrade anytime - and I did. As T&C stated they can automatically advance membership to free 30 days, I was not concerned. However, without any notice they automatically extended payed membership by 1 year and requested to pay annual fee in order to downgrade/cancel membership, referring to own T&C!Now I am trying to reach out to them, as I requested downgrade online - and these guys IGNORE my support request! Hope they will get huge penalty for fraud!
I'll start positively in an attempt to balance my review. I don't have a bad word to say about the people attending events, have great respect for the consuls and the events are reasonably ok but not necessarily worth paying for considering there are plenty of free alternatives out there. But that's where ends ... Internations as a business are crooks!! They attempt to auto bill you WITHOUT NOTIFICATION or clear instructions on how to cancel. They are happy to bill you for a service that you no longer use and are not happy to continue using which is a huge red flag for any business. Then they take it a step further by sending threatening emails claiming that you have to comply with their contract under German law with absolutely no regard for consumer rights and protection. I have even sent them documentation stating that under NZ law, that they must notify customers prior to billing them AND provide instructions on how to cancel. Simply saying it's in the T&C's or FAQs page is not acceptable and the inten...
THIEVES WILL NOT DELETE  DATA OR MEMBERSHIP OR REFUND YEARS OF UNUSED ( UNAWARE OF ) MEMBERSHIP.BEEN ASKING FOR MONEY FOR A SERVICE I HAVE REQUESTED SEVERAL TIMES TO GET OUT FROM SEVERAL TIMES , DURING A WORLD PANDEMIC.THEY ARE DISGUSTING.
An awful, experience. Charged me 90£ for the membership. I sent an email requesting a refund. The answer was no. I created another profile just to see how I managed to miss the fees when signed up. Took a screenshot of detailed fees saying its 7.95 per month.  Requested to keep7.95 and refund rest of the money. No reply. And my account has been deleted. Like seriously?! How can they delete my account after charging me 90£. If I don't get a refund I am entitled to use the site for 12months. scam!!!! I will try to find ways to get the justice done
Lovely concept and beautiful People. Amazing. You're never alone.In this difficult times, finding friends from all around @theWorld and attending video seminars has been a therapeutic and comforting experience for me. 🙏Chatting and sharing experiences with friends is emotionally very important. KUDOS! 👍Thank you Internations. Love 💗
Avoid joining as an Albatross Member! This is a scam to lock you into a membership with automatic payments that you can't get out of. Just like others who have reviewed here, I signed up for one event and decided to join as an Albatross Member. How foolish I was. They have been billing my credit card automatically without any notice every quarter. Recently my credit card number was changed and I had the opportunity to try and end my membership with them. I sent them an email immediately stating that I wanted to cancel my membership. No go. They sent me an email claiming Terms & Conditions, blah, blah. When I went on their website to downgrade my membership to Basic, which has no fee, I was unable to do this. Basically, either I pay the ransom of another quarter's fees, during a time when there are no activities by the way, or I can't even downgrade my membership and get out of this organization. For an organization that is supposed to be supporting international relations, I find it ironic that they hold t...
These people take your money without any advance notice. When you ask for a refund they refuse. They took 3 months membership fees from me without permission. Absolutely disgusting behaviour from a company. Basically they are thieves .
If I could give no stars, I would.Like many others here I have been conned into paying for an extra year. However, my card has been stopped because of another issue. I only have a card that the system does not recognise. I can't settle by cash apple pay or any like system.Suggested I get someone else to pay which is illegal and so reported them to German Financial authorities.Suggested I go to bank (during International Covid 19 lock down!I explained my personal circumstances and absolutely no  help or sympathy.I have had endless dubious emails through their system by what can only described as predatory men.Events were generally OK though one of my friends was felt up by someone at an event.I cannot say loudly enough - do not sign up and do not give your bank details. If they can't stop spam/hack emails how can they protect your financial footprint.
"Poor and clunky interface, and sneaky membership tactics. 1. Internations has a terrible user interface and full of people sending romantic proposals/interest. In saying that, I have met some good people on the platform.2. Events are crowdsourced and there is no system or method to organization. Internations relies on its members to execute things like events etc, but it's done haphazardly (my view is because there is a lack of clear guidelines/advice)3. Sneaky membership tactics - your membership is not cancelled upon non-payment. Instead internations continues with multiple threats to ""pay up or else"". My credit card details had changed and I forgot to change my payment details on Internations. I got some bizarre and aggressive reminders. This is not a bank!4.

Horrible customer service!!! I was charged for a full one year membership and I didn't know that I was on an automatic subscription. I didn't received any notification saying that I was on an automatic suscription or that I was going to be charged. I wrote them explaining them that I do not use their service and that I didn't know that I was on an automatic subscription and they refused to issue a refund. They say that since I accepted their terms and conditions I have to pay. I am going to issue a consumer protection complaint since this is abusive.
Be careful with this company, and do not sign up for the free month of Albatross membership.  You pay for the year in advance and there are no refunds, so once they draft your debit card, or even attempt to draft your debit card they have you.  When I didn't cancel after the first 30 days, they drafted my card.  I tried to get them to cancel the membership and return the money to my card, but they refused.  Ok... I got a year of Albatross... my mistake.  I didn't find Internations very useful, so I never went to the site and I forgot about it.  I replaced my debit card during the year, so when Internations tried to draft it, of course it wouldn't go through.  I told them I wasn't using the service and asked them cancel.  They refused.  I now had another year of Albatross membership that I couldn't cancel, only now I'm getting threatening emails.  I finally paid with a CREDIT CARD, contacted my bank and sent them them threatening emails from Internations.  My bank cancelled my credit card, sent me a new one...
"The Idea of InterNations is good to meet people and for networking on international level. But the app and website are not working properly. Unbelievable that the people who work there don't have the interest and the capacity to fix the issues that were reported multiple times over a longer period.I attended a few of their events and noticed that once you have met people trough InterNations they move AS A GROUP to whatsapp, LinkedIn and others to continue communicating, because the InterNations tool does not work. Even the InterNations ""consuls"" who manage specific interest groups (i.e. Culture events, ourtdoors, dining...) on behalf of InterNations, user other means of communcation. By the way, you are paying for membership NOT for service."
I cancelled subscription a week in advance. Heard nothing back. Then they tried to take 83 Euro from my account 10 times in two days. I wrote again asking them to stop. No reply. My credit card company finally blocked themIf there was an offer of 0 stars I would have chosen that.
I emailed internations to deleted my account in internations and also already downgrade my albatros membership but the account still there, active and now they ask me to pay! Threatened me as well
If you sign up for the free trial of 2 weeks, they automatically take payment even if you are just hours past the time frame for a three month's worth. Even if you contact them the minute this happens and ask them to cancel, they will say your purchase of this membership started 2 weeks ago, even if they just took payment. Oh by the way, the cancel auto-renew button is hidden behind many many menu items.It costs them absolutely nothing to cancel. Contact my credit card provider, who unfortunately read through the legal terms of the free trial and upheld Internation's decision.
I am now being threatened legally due to an auto renewal for my IN subscription - luckily my credit card has changed and payment did not go through. That said, I have now been sent 3 threatening emails regarding my outstanding subscription. The auto renew is not opt in, it is opt out. No notice is given before the renewal date. This company's ethics are not what one would expect. I will never subscribe to their services again. Googling this issue it is amazing how many similar stories are out there about InterNations and their legal threats about unpaid auto renewed subscriptions.
"I love the concept of ""You never stand alone"", the sense of camaraderie and tips and suggestions on how to live abroad. Great support from the Munich team."
Same story as everyone else-- I attempted to downgrade my account but their account management system is so convoluted that my request never went through. As a result I was billed for a service I believed I had cancelled, and customer service refused to issue a refund. They claim that many people find their automated renewal service to be helpful, that it saves them hassle, etc etc. Good grief. Wish I had read these reviews before I made the mistake of signing up!

"InterNations not for professional networkingThey bill themselves as... ""the largest international community for people who live and work abroad, InterNations offers global networking opportunities, local events, and expat-relevant information. ... To ensure the quality of the network, InterNations membership is by approval only.""  I joined so that I could network with Swedish language native speakers (I'm learning for a job in Sweden) and used the site to contact two members for this purpose.  Sadly, they never got back to me.  However, in the course of 13 days I have received 6 gross solicitations from men wanting to 'date' me.  Maybe it should be called TinderNations?  Foster Williams (Netherlands), Edwin Hill (Germany), Gregory Cheng (HK), Wilson Ethan (Pakistan), Mark Johnson (USA), and Richard William (Puerto Rico) start their emails to me like this... ""Hello beautiful.. I was wondering if its ok for us to be friends and maybe get to know each other if you don't mind?"" or ""Hello beautiful... your hair..."
"It's a great group and to be honest the not-great parts have to do with the members, not those who work for InterNations. Some members are rude and lack manners, others are perverts and stalkers, some are clear opportunists seeking to promote their own business agenda and others (mainly young girls) are looking for someone to attach themselves to and emigrate with; in other words InterNations is their exit plan from Africa. So it is the members and not the staff who prove problematic. There is little we can do about who joins but we should just be as thorough as possible in the vetting process - and that process should continue throughout that person's membership. Some slip through the net and once they have been accepted as members, then start misbehaving. But because they have already been accepted as members, it's hard to get rid of them because they have already been vetted so to speak. So InterNations, while being a super organisation, needs to be stricter about who can join - and/or be quite firm abo..."
Great site for expats. They take security seriously and have a great customer service.
I reported probable scammer and he was checked and blocked
I reported a spoof fake user who sent me spam and the support person cancelled the spammers account and notified me within 1-2 hours.Thanks Dani!

the support was great and efficient
Customer service is so good but the app have many bugs. Apparently there is nobody working in fix all the problems that the app has. I have sent many emails and they don’t care. I really don’t understand how this public company does not have enough tech people that can improve their systems.I really like InterNations community but sometimes I get tired from how the app works. So bad.
There is a hook to get you interested and leads one to believe that you need the paid subscription (NOT worth what you pay for it). THEN there is an automatic renewal WITHOUT NOTIFICATION and they are worthless enough that they wont refund it even when you try to address the fact that there was NO NOTIFICATION of a pending renewal. So they have got my $ and I dont even visit the site anymore and it never was worth it even when I did.
Very helpful team with immediate actions taken. Thanks for your support!
It is an excellent platform to make new friends from different parts of the world, to know their culture ,share our thoughts ,organize events in multiple disciplines. Great work and commitment . Kudos to the team of InterNations.👏🏻
Internations is simply one of the best family platform community.
I found the whole experience very positive. It was done in a very friendly,helpful and professional manner.
I just want to warn people who are considering it an alternative as a dating app that it might not be the best choice.
Less than 24 hrs response and action taken is good job.
MErci for so quick solition ....HkN
THEY ARE GREEDY. I UNDERSTAND THE BAD REVIEWS NOW. A COMPANY WITH SUCH BAD REVIEWS WONT LAST FOREVER
If you give your credit card details good luck trying to stop auto renewal!These practices where cancelling auto renew is all but invisible, complex illogical steps requiring huge amounts of time and selecting options using confusing wording. This practice is cynical and frankly should be illegal and in fact may well be in certain circumstances and jurisdictions. Unbecoming of a group that purports to be a professional networking group.Complex to stop endless e-mails, messages and notifications. The website is an unforgivably complex mess and auto renewal would probably be deemed illegal in a UK court in my opinion as cancelling is so complex. I spent 20-30 minutes working out what I think is the correct process (downgrading your membership as opposed to cancelling auto renewal!) but have not received a confirmation e-mail that auto renewal has been cancelled. I can find no option of removing my credit card details so they seem to hold on to that without any option to have the data removed. I offer this as...
"Have complained several times about how unsafe I feel as a member of InterNations, each time they thank me for the information given but again and again I keep receiven contact requests from ""false profiles"" asking to contact me via my personal email. I got so tired of this that decided not to renew my membership, Thought that this site was a good place for networking and for meeting interesting ant trusful people... but not."
It was wonderful to meet everyone last night at Assembly in Canberra. I had a great time meeting Dominic, the ambassador of InterNations in Canberra who was very friendly and interactive. I also met people from different parts of the world from Africa, Europe and other regions as well as from the Middle East where I came from. We exchanged numbers and also we met a lovely couple who we may catch up with later. The place and environment were ideal and the people were friendly.
many email on my email account that i have received from internations while my account was active, if i can put it this way. now today i got a reply here that they cannot find any emails connected to any accounts. my name is anisa xhafaj and i was using my account normally without disturbing nobody , until one morning, i tried to login, and i got an error message saying that no accounts was found associated to my email address . and today on trust pilot, the internations team asked me to write their support directly from their page, wich that was the first thing i did, but i never got a reply. this is very unproffesional service,accounts dont just dissapear, they get deleted , wich means mos likely someone from internations team deactivated my account without notification, and i never breached any of their policies
maria from community support is a professional and excellent
Support executives promptly help with a positivity and ensure that all members are at ease.
Great support but limited functionality of web tools. Webpage tools simple to use but of limited functionality. Did meet 5 people in 1 week of tge 30 contacted. Activities organized about 3 to 4 times a month for the groups I selected. Remains a useful application for expatriates who want to socialize and learn local customs and culture. Over 70 percent are either Greek or dual citizens that include Greeks in the Athens location.
Internations is a great platform made by people who care about people.They offer a social network and they act like this.They also have know-how on customer service and this quality is confirmed in each request I had over the past 11 years that I have been a member of the Internations community.I like it and I truly recommend it!

I think this group is so much like the school clubs of theta,pi and kappa clubs. Very snooty and privileged membership. They give no reason for declining your request. They are not at all open minded and it appears like they may have some invisible rules of race and gender to top it all. Do not join.
"If it was possible I would put less than 1 star."" We are very sorry for your feedback...bla bla bla..'' I received so many menecing letters from this company. Though I have never ever attended any of their hang outs. Dear Ali,This is the final notice that you owe us $59.40 for your Albatross Membership. Your payment is now 77 days late.If we don’t receive your payment within 48 hours, we reserve the right to sell your debt to an external party, which may result in additional costs for you."
I was pleased to find the possibility of joining social groups as I had moved to a new country.The meetings are arranged by volunteers but It soon becomes apparent that you can only effectively join these meetings if you pay a subscription to Internations. A prominently displayed free trial was offered as an Albatross member which I accepted. I missed the 14 day cancellation window and found myself paying for a year of membership. I would not have chosen to upgrade but I had not cancelled the free trial and therefore this was an understandable consequence. During my initial active period when logged in, I received a large number of scam messages from people claiming to be a single father and how attractive they found me etc etc. I sent a message about this via Internations internal system. There was no response from Internations.I found message boards contained a lot of postings by people promoting the possibility of money transfer and other more normal conversational pieces were outdated. I lost trust in ...
I would avoid this organisation mainly due to their complaints handling process which is non existent.
They advertise their app everywhere. Makes you to sign up for free, in a trial version and then charge you without notification for three months. If you write to custumer support to delete your data and to refund you because you dont want their service, they wont reply you. Do not expect a refund from them. Really dissapointed. I didnt expect this from a German company!!!! It should ti be ashamed.
I think it's absurd to pay to meet new people. There are plenty of groups or events on other platforms that are open to everyone and you don't need to pay for them. I don't recommend Internations, you can find new friends for free.
- Got the cost covered for the first signup by my employer.- Never used the service since I found everything was either uninteresting or expensive and the only event I wanted to go was cancelled.- I did not see an option of auto-renewal when signing up for the membership.- Never got a reminder by email about the membership being auto-renewed, even though they seem to find e-mails very useful for notifying about everything else. I see posts complaining about this from years ago, so I would say they have no interested in solving the 'problem'.- When I asked for support, instead of bonafide help, I got the unpleasant and unhelpful response covering their practice, pointing out that this is for my own convenience (oh boy) and getting technical showing me that it is all my fault because this was in the terms and conditions.It appears to me that they have no interest in helping people when it comes to not making this mistake, which even if it was legal because of a loophole (I hope it's not, and I am trying to g...

InterNations GmbH (interNationsorg) has adopted series of marketing strategies that has managed to successfully lure unsuspecting victims to their platform. As per so many reviews all over the internet, it is evident that, the moment they get their hands on your credit/debit card information you are DOOMED. It is best to err on the side of caution and stay away from their platform or IMMEDIATELY DELETE your account.Ambassadors and Consuls are lured into sponsoring events with their own pocket monies with the promise of catering for purported expats and working professionals whilst InterNations continue to bill unsuspecting members and pocket almost 84 euros a year at all cost. The only way for these unsuspecting ambassadors and or consuls to recover their own money back is to charge entrance fees for the events they host on the interNations platform as purported VOLUNTEERS. The funny and ironic part is that, these events are hardly attended by their members as attendants stand at 6-15%. Members would signu...
I had the same bad experience with the InterNations. I am a member of InterNations organization for 5 years. Last month I signed up for the free trial of Albatros Membership. I canceled my free trial during my free trial period. It seemed I was downgraded to Basic Membership.  However yesterday I was charged with the subscription fees as one single payment (83,40 Euro). I don't want to become an Albatros Member, and due to this, I am a very injured party. I want to get my money back. It is a very substantial situation for me. If you don't give me my money back I will sue for this company!
Agree with others, typical company seeking profit and nothing else
Same issues as others, not proper alerting for renewal, just direct billing, nonuser friendly membership update options, bad customer service and support interaction with Internations representatives.LATER EDIT: As you can see from Internations reply - they are clearly not understanding the business they are in, or the multiple customer bad feedback they received so far - for exactly the same reason.... @INTERNATIONS - do you understand the problem here, or are we talking to the walls??? Your's T&C :Consumer’s Right to Cancellation (Gesetzliches Widerrufsrecht für Verbraucher)If a user uses the services for a purpose that is not related to either his or her commercial or freelance activity (Consumer according to Section 13 German Civil Code), the following provisions shall apply to Consumers with usual residence in the EU or the EEA:Right to Cancellation and Exercise of Such RightIn accordance with Section 246a German Introduction Act to the German Civil Code (Einführungsgesetz zum Bürgerlichen Gesetzbuch)...

I agree with the many other reviewers who were horrified to find it impossible to cancel the membership. When my credit card expired, I knew that was the only way to get out of this terrible company. Now I am continually hounded and threatened for payment.This is the worst public relations situation I have ever encountered. Do not join!
I wish I would have reviewed this site before agreeing to sign up for this scam. I was scammed the same way as many others that have posted. I found it ridiculously difficult to find out how to cancel my membership.  However, my card was expiring and I knew I couldn’t be charged when my subscription was over. Next thing I know, I’m getting emails from Internations legal department threatening to send me to collections for $60.  I did not pay to renew or receive any services(To be honest, this program is really just a creepy, expensive hook up program.). It took 3-4 days to finally get someone to respond to my emailed complaints. The response was the same as the others that have reviewed this site. Does anyone know if they can actually send you to collections for not paying? Do not sign up for this program.  It is a very big scam.
InterNations does nothing to prevent people from posting adds and spam across the forums, nor does it remove them.
I signed up for 3 months only then they renewed my membership again without my consent. There is no way to cancel it on the App or the Website. I have sent 3 requests and still no feedback. I just want my refund and membership cancellation.
"I emailed them before the free trial expiry date as I could not find the way to cancel my membership under ...""Membership""! which is where you'd expect it to be. I contacted ""support"" and asked to cancel my membership and got no answer, yet they took my money. I emailed them a couple of times later and got no answer either (on the site which is where Id expect to geta response as I emailed them here). They claim they emailed me on my hotmail account but I never got it. I am asking for a refund as they way they took my money is dishonest and the membership cancellation feature deceptively difficult to find and conducive to trick you into renewing your membership against your will as its been the case hereThey eventually answered but they refuse to acknowledge facts (1) that I notified cancellation and asked for instructions to cancel well before expiry date, cos I could not find it under the Membership tab which is where anyone would expect to find it, 2) that I did not get any response and hence I kept ema..."
I've also been cheated by the albatross scheme. Given this, I recommend not joining
Please do some research before signing up any plan that required you to pay something. There is many too good to be true networking platform out there. Scammers is everywhere and waiting to cheat your precious money. Be vigilant!
"My experience is the same as everyone else’s, unfirtunately. Internations took three months’ membership fee from my account before the trial period was over, and it has been impossible to get in touch with a person, I only get robot replies. I knew early that the Company was not for me; they spammed me with worthless stuff, so I signed out, and still, they took my money. So many unhappy people here, we should be able to be heard."
The current billing policy is clearly a disappointment at Internations. I used to enjoy their evens organised in the Switzerland, however their recent episode on my automatically extended membership went too far. ( I used a virtual cc. when I paid my first membership, clicking on non-automatic renewal is not available on payment,.Members do not pay attention to this later on, so you will end up receiving their letter threatening with a lawywer and credit collection companies. Their behaviour is very unethical.
Shameful service. Coward practices.To my luck, I haven't allowed the automatic renew and you are still sending me an invoice. I hope you understand you are possessing my data against my allowance. I have already requested formally to delete my account and personal data. I don't need to remember you about new laws regarding possession of personal data. Let's see how it goes. I am open to talk, even if I have to pay a small amount to cancel my account, but I don't agree with this scandalous and scoundrel practice forcing me to renew the membership. Please, let me know what I have to do after you not receive the payment. Thanks.Luiz Filho
Don't forget the free trial of this worthless service!! I signed up as I'm living abroad, quickly found the service to be of no personal value, and promptly forgot about the free trial. On the day I noticed my card had been charged 84 USD I emailed saying I forgot and would like to cancel. They promptly said no. I understand I had plenty of time to cancel, but we get busy and forget things. Obviously this company survives on their free trials, and not the quality of customer service!
I have repeatedly reported on contact requests from scammers such as Juan Babieca, for instance, assigned to agent, Andrada, report 106212, and I continue to update my dissatisfaction!I am unhappy with the complete lack of verification of the authenticity of new members.  It would be relatively simple to verify the identity of members by requesting a copy of a government issued form of identification with a photograph like a copy of a passport or national ID, and an issuance of a membership card, to be retrieved with the said ID.  Instead, InterNations has become a notorious social network that can easily be utilized repeatedly by Nigerian419 scammers, as well as other scammers who enroll with false names and stolen pictures in order to make contact with bona fide members and try to squeeze money from them using dishonest stories.  There is not an expat on earth who has not been issued a government ID of some sort.  How difficult is it for you to attempt to verify a person's identity before accepting their...
My sing up declined manny timesWithout answers
After reading the review of other users, I will just add my story on top of that but I can only confirm that Internations is company that offers the worst customer service I had in my entire life. They do this process to get you have a trial period which of course you forget to cancel. and guess what? 90euros charged on your account and NO possibility to ask for the refund even if you're not using the service. After carefully reading their terms and conditions, there's a point where you can claim a cancellation of the service within 15 days from the start of the membership, but if you try to request that right they deny it giving all sort of explanation that are not aligned with what is written on their website. I am currently in touch with the consumers association as the client service has not been able to solve my issue and made me invest so much time on the topic.
Omg I thought i was the only one to have the problem with automatic renewal and no reminders. I agree with all other comments, i’ve had same  Disappointing  experience. be aware that once you subscribe they won’t send you any reminders before renewal and will keep charging until you downgrade somewhere in your account settings. Don’t expect any understanding or compassion even if you haven’t attended their events in the last year.  All in all, just be aware
Before the end of my trial period i tried to downgrade the membership, i had a technical problem and was unsure if the downgrade was successful so I called internations number many times on diferent days in hope for assitance Now after the full amount of membership was taken from my account immediately after thr trial period ended i again tried to contact them and pleased them to pay me back as it was never my intention to start a membership, even after explaining them my issues they did not help me and forced me to pay for the whole year.I am not interested at all in the membership however internations is making money even if people have problems using their app, there is nobody picking up their service number that is stated on their website! I would never recommend to anyone to get a membership at internations!
Sneaky auto renewal without warning and no refund
When I started free trial, I looked around and found out that Internations are pretty useless to connect expats. But I kept my free trial to see if something would change. As it happens, I forgot completely that they will charge me after one month of free trial. I knew about it, I was just thinking that it will be like one month of membership or something. What a mistake!!! They charged me for whole year after my free trial run out. So I emailed them that it was a mistake. I didnt plan to buy a year membership, but I admit it was my bad, so I propose to charge me just for month or so. They decline, because I could clearly see the information in check out page or in Membership page on my account. But come on!! this is just cheap trick. Their product is obviously worthless and they have to make money when people simply forget about their subscription. So whoever started your free trial, pay attention to your end of free trial date!!
The worst social network platform I had ever been registered to. Clearly, they don't have good intentions offering the Albatross subscription. Fortunately, I didn't save my card details on their website so they won't be able to charge me automatically however they kept sending me aggressive e-mail sounding like threatening. I don't know any platform having this type of subscription policy. I definitely do NOT recommend others to use this app. I don't know the exact status of Internations's offer however if they gave up Albatross program they may come up soon with another program that won't be very fair towards the members. Please be aware of that. It's no coincidence that so many users of Internations gave such a bad review.In addition, It would be extremely good to give the right reviews that represent their last actions on the App Store and Google Play.
"Again, it's impossible to delete the account until you pay the subscription. By the way, InterNations guys, by refusing to delete the account if the membership is unpaid,  in France you violate the General Data Protection Regulation (2016/679, applicable since 25 May 2018). But apparently you don't care about laws when these laws protect  other people, not you. The problem is that InterNations are completely aware of what they do. They reply ""ok, the information about your membership is available here and there, etc."" as if they did not understand why people feel cheated. Yet they realize perfectly what's going on. They know that they never remind their clients that the membership will be renewed. This happens silently - no e-mail notifications, nothing. But if you change your bank details and they are unable to process the payment they will bury you under tons of mails. And it will be impossible to refuse, you will have to pay like 80 dollars just to delete your account! To put it another way, LEAVING INT..."
I made a subscription and they renewal it without my confirmation.Now they are sending emails that my payment is overdue and their website don't allow me to contact them.Awful serviceAnswer to Internations reply.So if I can't access my account for long time one day I will be contacted by a depth collector. That's awesome...I know your helpline but is not useful if I can't access it.
Aggressive membership policyAs with other reviews here, beware this organisation. Once you sign up there is no way to unsubscribe before they slap you with demands for membership dues, sent out without prior notification. No matter how hard you try to cancel your membership, threats of debt collectors are sent out if you do not pay. InterNations are well aware the damage debt collection will have on credit scores, and so rely on acquiescence to avoid credit score damage. Both the German founders remain dumb to appeals, and continue to promulgate this organisation through their LinkedIn profiles. Steer well clear if you don't want to be plagued by incessant demands for money, for a membership you didn't sign up for.
I have had a personal bad experience with this company. Prior ro the process of creating an account I have not seen or received any information that clearly indicates that you will be required to sign up for a membership fee in order to use the services that this company promotes. Until then the benefits to use Internations are very limited, if not inexistant.Furtermore the process to remove and delete my account was far from being simple. I needed to send a couple of messages as I could not find any guidance online. Meanwhile I kept on receiving excessive marketing emails.
"After reading all these bad reviews I am actually happy that InterNations declined my membership request. At the beginning, I was very enthusiastic about joining them and their international community, but I got frustrated with their reply about declining my membership request. It is very disappointing that such a ""prestigious"" organisation could not make an effort to prepare a better e-mail. In my opinion, it is very unprofessional to reject a person based on a few questions and an e-mail address. It seems to me that InterNations is a very exclusive group where only selected few can have access to their ""precious"" service. I wonder what kind of criteria you need to meet to join their ""renowned"" community? But, now I can say: thank you InterNations for declining my request! You saved my time dealing with you and the problems some other people are facing. :)Ps. After the negative experience with InterNations, my husband also thinks that InterNations is a farse and he is going to cancel his membership."
great thing if you are new to a city or country and if you are looking for contacts. But also as a local it is a nice opportunity to meet people from all over the world with different backgrounds and jobs. There are plenty of different groups with different activities in my city.Only one thing - before it was possible to search for people by nationality. This option seems to have disappeared.
I joined internations  as an albatross for 6 months in January 2019 and never find time to attend events.  At the end of the 6 months I decided not to proceed. To my disgust, I noted that internations had tried to withdraw from my credit card for another 6 months and are now claiming that I owe them another US $41.I have repeatedly told them that I am not interested in continuing but they keep on sending these letters and trying to threaten me. I now see another letter whether they are telling me that they will sell my debt. Am so put off and absolutely disgusted. Somebody out there please give me answers
It's an odd way to get your hard earned cash...Repeat invoices for services never requested, a refusal to dialogue and a determination to continue to email you until you eventually submit to their demands. There is no way to delete your profile until payment has been made, which is against all of the consumer laws in the EU - the founders are German. The founders are unreachable, unaccountable, and living off expropriated funds through misleading and unclear instructions on their platform. (this post has had to be moderated as Internations objected to the truth being writ large about their methods, instead of entering a dialogue)STEER CLEER.
I have red some of the reviews and I’m seeing that most of them have the same problem than me. I’ve been charged for a Albatross membership that I never ask, I don’t have any email confirmation about accepting this, now I’m overdue and they say I have to pay before cancel the membership. I live in Colombia which here the currency is Colombian pesos but they are charging me in dollars. I never expect this about a “serious company”, I don’t recommend InterNatios, I think they abuse of the members.
Registered september 2018. Got an email in June saying 'This free upgrade is an automatic, one-time gift for you. There’s no obligation and we don’t require any credit card details.'. In August I received a reminder email of a bill of 60euros. They claim my credit card details needs to be updated because the payment did not go through. I have never given them any card details. This makes me wonder whose fake card details do they claim to have associated with my profile? I do believe this qualifies as fraud. This seems to happen to many people and they are very clever to make it seem that we did something wrong. Make sure to submit legal enquires to the authorities that deal with fraud.
For years I always have a great time with friends in the social meetings I attended. Also with the administration and financials, everything has been correct and friendly. I appreciate good service when I feel it.Keep the good job.
"I wish I had seen all of these negative reviews before I joined.  I would  not have made the same mistake.  I have had the same horrible experience with the so called ""customer support"" team.I was a member for a year.  I only went to a couple of events, and while it certainly wasn't bad, it wasn't enough that I wanted to remain a member.  This certainly isn't the most important thing going on in my life and so I kind of forgot about it until a few days ago when I saw on my credit card statement that my membership had auto-renewed.  I immediately contacted ""customer support"" and  asked to cancel the membership and refund the charge from one day prior.  They have taken the very rigid and unsupportive position of ""you should have known it was going to auto-renew"" and we absolutely will not refund your money.  This just isn't the way a customer-friendly organization does business, and anyone thinking of joining should be aware of it.**UPDATE**  I disputed the charge with my credit card company, and they resolv..."
If you join this organization, be very careful about paid membership.Stick with a free membership.
I singed up for this site for free to find some friends in Bulgaria. The website was very not search friendly with no value in it and I gave up in couple of weeks late and set a rule of moving Internations emails into the junk box. How much was my surprise when one their email reached my inbox with warning that they upgraded me to “albatross” and NOW they want money from me. What is a SCAM! I have never seen any web with 93% of NEGATIVE FEEDBACK! I probably will record a feedback on camera for the youtube for people to be aware about this site.
Frankly, I don't really understand where these bad reviews are coming from. I've been a member of InterNations for 5 years, have attended great events, don't mind paying a nominal fee for meeting interesting people and the diversity events makes this great fun. Plus, I recently switched from being an organizer on MeetUp to InterNations due to the fact MeetUp was suddenly making us pay much more and charge for our events and my group began to dwindle. I have found a better quality of people in InterNations who show up because they've paid a small fee to join. And, I have had great support as both a member and an organizer. I don't even get some of the comments here unless they were people who are venting because they did something that caused a negative experience, or I also acknowledge that the groups may be different in oher cities or countries.
"InterNations.org insist on demanding my participation in a membership for entertainment that has expired, I no longer enjoy and have no intent on renewing (saved by an expired credit card that prevented the organization's automatic deduction).  They say: That my membership has already been renewed, yet I can not access the account or thus, see the page content;That I am responsible for allowing auto pay of the membership amount simply because they have set it up in a way that extorts money from unsuspecting good-intentioned members;That I must continue to allow them to entertainment me against my will and interest, and I also must pay them to do it;That they will attempt to collect the cash from me through a collector (international collector I would imagine)  who like them, don't understand e-consumer rights. PLEASE,TO EVERYONE TO WHOM THIS HAS HAPPENED.1)  Dispute unauthorized charges with your credit card or banking institute for renewed charges you did not authorized.  Most will recoup the monies from ..."
"I signed up for their Albatros Membership. I moved and stopped using the site. They couldn't renew my membership automatically because my card details changed. Now they're sending threatening emails citing ""German law"" and threatening to sell my name to a credit agency. Good grief."
This is a dangerously disguised dating site used primarily by deviant men targeting naive, helpless, disenfranchised immigrant women.Please be vigilant and highly aware. Do NOT post photos or a sad story. Do NOT agree to meet. Though I erred my complaints to the Ambassador and lead organizer of our Calgary, Alberta area...she did NOTHING to remove the serial predator. They are all in it for promiscuity. Please be aware.
As everyone has said, this appears to be an unfulfilling experience.Self-renewing subscriptions with insufficient warning and cool-off periods are written about extensively by EU trading regulators.Having to pay to unsubscribe from emails is not usual.  Self-renewing subscriptions without cancellation possibilities or warnings are not usual.If you consider communications to be unreasonable and time consuming, you might charge back any professional fees and time you incur.You may consider the impossibility of unsubscribing from emails without charge is of interest to those who regulate such behaviour, or you may not.  The GDPR helplines might be of interest to you, or they may not.Your experience - good or bad - might bring you to write to your MEP who generally take an interest in facilitating cross-border transactions.
So they offer you a free trial and say you can end it at anytime. However it didn’t say then the trial trial ended and when I went back to cancel I’d been charged almost £80 for not even using the site. This is how they make there money. As you can imagine I’m pretty annoyed off with this German company and currently looking into getting a refund or I may well take legal action against them.
"Over the course of a year's Albatross membership I put up with activities that were either filled up within minutes or that had 100+ attendees. True meaning of ""Albatross""?  They renewed my membership without warning although I never agreed to auto-renewal.  Of course they won't refund a cent. I only wish there were negative star reviews."
Don't ever ever sign up. Don't ever sign up. They are of the highest degree. Extremely bad user policies and they do NOT refund the fortune charged if you forget to cancel the subscription. Afraid to lose out - Even made me tone this review down. Please make yourself a favor, don't sign up.Please don't sign up on Internations. Never Ever.
"I was an Albatros member but I didn't wish to continue and downgraded it however InterNations didn't take that into account and they sent me an email stating that I should pay 84 euros because they extended my Albatros membership without my will. No calls, no email reminders, nothing before that. They didn't even needed to call me when they couldn't withdrawn the money. Any platform, at least the serious ones, always remind you before when they're not able to withdraw money and they say your account is on HOLD till payment. However, InterNations, trying to be clever and automatically extend your membership even though they cannot withdraw money, then come back to you and say ""pay now"". I tried to explain them by email, however they started sending threat messages telling that they will get the money by a collector agency in case I don't pay. That's really unbelievable to see something from a platform which claims to be 'serious'..."
I should have read these reviews before signing up for Internations. All the comments about their horrific renewal policy is true. they charge you for a service not yet availed and refuse to refund the amount thats charged for the subsequent year. All this in the name of convenience for the customer who may forget to renew the subscriptiuon. If the customer is not using the service and has forgotten to renew the service, the message is loud and clear.. They have illogical representatives who give canned responses which are no good as well..No phone number to call and no escalation process. Only a bunch of impossible customer service representatives who keep sending the same responses over and over again. Never ever sign up for Internations.. Its an organization with sub standard and customer unfriendly practices and not professional enough to sign up for in the first place.
IF A METEORITE HITS THE EARTH AND THE SURVIVORS EMERGE IN RAGS, INTERNATIONS WILL STILL FIND A WAY TO KEEP ON BILLING. I used Internations while living in Nairobi after being persuaded by a work colleague. After going on a free trial, it is set up to charge you ridiculous amounts as secretly as possible on a concurrent basis. I paid for the first 6 months willingly, but got charged after this. When I realised 'my' error a day after the payment went through and contacted Internations explaining that I would like to cancel my membership as I know longer needed it, and to please refund the £79 I paid automatically the day before (needless to say they gave no notice that my previous membership was about to be renewed). Internations' response? Two fingers and some harping on about their terms and conditions. There were some good hiking events organised. But this has NOTHING to do with Internations, rather the unpaid reps who could have just as easily organised it through Facebook. I tried to attend an Internati...
Just wrote to them and got this reply .......Thank you for your interest in our international community. We regret to inform you that your request for membership has been declined.................................................................................WowActually, if you would have said, that you are not taking more members, that would have been more understandable.Saying that, my membership request has been declined is little insulting to both to me as a person and to your forum for not putting it right. Especially when you have not asked me anything about myself - other than Confirming my email address, and thats it.You could have asked for my UK Passport having evidence of frequent travelling, once every 45 days for last 4 years   to and back UK and PK. As my job is in PK and my home and family are in the UK.Reason for joining the forum WAS ..... That my family is moving to PK in Nov and I thought it would be best to ask the members who have moved from UK to PK about their experience and feedbac...
Internations is a great option for connecting with new people and discovering interesting venues. During 5 years I am being a member i only had very positive experiences and met some great friends. I see many complaints about subscriptions renewals and honestly dont get the reason of those bad reviews... I ve been in and out of Albatros membership and never had an anauthorized charges...And anyway, some 70 eur is well worth for being able to join great events internationally. Keep doing great job Internations.org👏👏👏👍
"I can only compare my experience with Internations to an experience in dealing with scammers. This ""business"" has moral compass which is completely broken. I am, in fact, really surprised that they do actually have paying subscribers... I signed to their trial membership at which point they asked for payment details. I selected Paypal and activated the trial. In the weeks that followed, I came to the conclusion that the site does not provide anything I would not be able to find elsewhere for free. So, having had no good reason to come back, I forgot the trial and got on with my life. That is, until one day I received a confirmation from Paypal that payment for EUR87 has been processed by Internations. Immediately I got in touch with their customer support explaining that I do not find their service sufficiently useful and therefore I do not require this membership. The dismissive and condescending way in which they regarded my query was rather off putting. Basically, the sense I got from them was ""We've go..."
Hi, avoid this service at all cost. They have auto renewal in place for subscription and for some reason if your card in file is outdated , they don't discontinue your membership, they still continue your membership and come after you with a pay or legal action attitude. Save yourself some headache.
My primary complaint is that customer service representative Jasmine refused to give me the contact to make a complaint regarding their policy and then told me she would ignore any further communication! Here is a direct quote from her email: “At this point, we see no reason to escalate this matter further and consider this case closed. We will not be replying to any of your further requests regarding this matter.” This is completely unacceptable practice to refuse to offer a paying customer an avenue to make a complaint. What’s more is they use an auto renewal system that’s impossible to figure out how to cancel on your own. Automatically sign you up for auto renewal with inability to set it to manual. Terrible customer service in general. Won’t offer any reprieve considering the terrible system, even when you never even log into the site - probably because they would not have any income without making it so complicated for people, essentially manipulating them out of their money. If you read their review...
Dear in Munich,I see only a little problem.Several times I have sent a card, but the contend of my card, even my specific questions never got correct answered. I always get a general answer.Maybe your get to much letters and you can not go into detailed answers for a sisingular member, which I understand.I will write again.In the mean time take care.Gregory
"no option in the settings to cancel membership or to downgrade after the free trial. I've googled how to do it but the option ""change membership"" wasn't there...opened all possible buttons i see but didn't find it still. My membership was automatically renewed and now they're demanding for payment."
I used InterNations once. After a while I deleted my account, and I tried to make a new one after several months. When I was rejected I asked the reasons why and this was their response:Dear Sir or Madam, Thank you for getting in touch with us.We're sorry to say that your application has been declined and this decision is final. We recommend trying again at a later date in the future. Kind regards,JasmineInterNations Support TeamI am very disappointed that they did not provide me to the reasons why I was rejected to create an account. I found it rude that they said : this decision is final. I would rate it as a modern dating site. Not working one.
Tried to cancel but no - Internations turned greedy and is extorting me - Worst social network ever.Your Account Is Temporarily BlockedPayment for your Albatross Membership was due on 26 Mar 2019, but we were unable to process the charge. You have been notified both on the InterNations website and by email that this payment is overdue, and your account is now frozen until your subscription fees have been paid.To get your account back and avoid further legal action, please settle this charge immediately — we reserve the right to transfer the claim to a debt collection agency if this bill remains unpaid.
I share the same experience: the Internations network it is abusive. I j joined the network 3 years ago and all in a sudden, without any information, they tell me I have to pay, this is insane! I suggest everybody not to join this network which is all about profit and has nothing to do with the réal spirit of meeting people. Relationships and encounters should be for free.
Avoid at all costs! I kept getting emails of a free 30 day membership and it said I could cancel at any time during this trial. So I signed up to try it and 2 days later they had deducted all the money for the 3 months I had signed up for at one go. When I emailed them they can me a useless response after 5 days referring to there terms and condition. No doubt they will copy paste the same response as they have for everyone else that feels scammed...we are sorry you feel this way ...it clearly said in our term and condition. What is shocking is that a lot of people feel scammed so clearly they are doing something wrong here and yet taking no responsibility than copy pasting the same response. Extremely shocking that companies can work like this and put the blame on us. They just want to make money at all costs and don’t know that customer satisfaction means. Avoid avoid avoid!
As an expat since 2011 in various cities already, I've made friends all over the world thanks to the various events that I joined with InterNations. Back in Australia, but also in Italy and now in the Netherlands, where I've met very interesting people from all the world while attending not only sport activities but also charity actions and other fun get-togethers. When needed, their customer support team has been not only quick with their replies to my requests but also really friendly. The Ambassadors and Consuls are really helpful too! I really recommend the platform if you are new in town and are looking to make friends! Don’t hesitate!
They never informed me that my trial period was over and they charged my credit card without informing me. This was last year and i did not realise what had happened. Today I saw an unusual transaction on my paypal account and found out that they have been charging me last year and now without informing. I was really upset and asked immediately for a cancellation of membership and refund, but they responded that they cannot refund me since they i have agreed with their policies. Legal probably, but as others have said below TOTALLY UNETHICAL and consumer unfriendly treatment. I will be a lot more careful in the future, after this experience. Also, I think that if all of us, who have been charged without permission and not refunded, hire a lawer as a group, we can achieve to close them down. I believe that lots of people fall into their 'legal' business everyday.
Not even worth the 1 star!I signed up to meet new people when we relocated. Then thought it could potentially be good to hold groups to increase business just to be rejected by management for wanting to host a group related to my work. (It was a support group for Mums and babies as I’m a mum myself) Anyways, throughout the year didn’t use it much as it was never relevant to me. 2 days ago I got a notification that I’ve paid €71,40 to InterNations. I was never sent a notification that my membership would renew automatically. I immediately requested a refund, explaining that i was unaware and haven’t even been using my account for a very long time. They now refuse to give me a refund stating that an Albatross symbol on my profile picture on my internations account is there to remind me every day that I will have to pay a renewal fee without being notified!!! I feel stolen from. I don’t recommend wasting your time or money to join this ridiculous network who claims to be a ‘community network’. They obviously ...
"Email Message I recieved from Internations:""Since your Albatross Membership subscription is a legal contract, it can only be terminated by following the proper cancellation procedure. Withholding your payment for a service you subscribed to is not equivalent to cancelling your contract. If your balance remains unpaid, we’re legally required to follow a debt collection process and additional administrative fees may apply. To avoid this, please pay your invoice.""My reply:""I have already written several emails to request withdrawl of my membership. I cannot be forced to be a member of a social group. Please reply with confirmation that I have been removed from your group successfully.""This group poses as a social networking group, yet claims the auto-renewal is a legal binding contract. Even Amazon lets you cancel your Prime account and refunds you the balance. Obviously, Internations is not interested in their community nor their reputation.

I love a lot InterNations! Their website is excellent, their customer service is also excellent, the concept is great, the events are very high quality, and on top of that we meet people from all over the world!
I signed up to potentially meet new people in my new city but was constantly harassed by organisers of events when i showed interest on attending events( which are never free) Then if i confirmed that i would attend, i would get harassed to reconfirm again. Not the most sophisticated member organisation to join.They also make it almost impossible to downgrade your account.Avoid at all costs. Facebook has many more free and useful groups to join with kind, helpful people.
Once you pay, you can't cancel. Crazy. They have it in FAQs, but in reality, you don't find that option to cancel/downgrade.
I have been following this website since this winter and I've noticed that recently InterNations has suddenly started to answer to all the complaints with the more or less same text ( precisely speaking since this April). It changes a bit according to the content of each complaint but the base is always the same using its GTC and description on the invoice. Why is this organization so boring and annoying without never thinking about their customers? Why don't they try to improve their service?  I've already left InterNations because I hate this organization's business scheme based on profit seeking policy without listening to their customers' voices. It is very clear that the core problem of this organization is auto renewal of Albatross membership without any pre-notice to their members, yet they don't want to change it stubbornly even though it is not convenient for their customers ( all the claims derive from this tricky system).
Customer service - non existing.They are horrible people and this is th reason why they dont have a telephone number that you could reach them on.I signed up for a free trail! 30 day free trail.I cancelled my account on the 30th day, however, they still took  my money!It was confirmed on the website, that on the day I cancelled the membership, that was the last day of it.Now they do not want to refund me my money and say that missed the cutoff by 2 hours! it was a correct day but I missed their cut of by 2 hours! they do not mention hours, but say 30 days!When I requested my refund, they said that if I mention one again that I want a refund, then they will not respond to me!
Worst community you can ever join!if i had lower ratings to give i would give so. As mentioned numerous times before they charge you automatically. Also, you dont allow me to remove my card details. How can you exploit expats so horribly. I would request you to kindly refund me my money as i am not interested in being your member in the first place. I will ensure my company do not pass on your memberships to expats. Hope you play attention to this and support.
Do not subscribe the Albatross Membership!!! Their whole business is based on making you impossible to unregister. They do not inform you when they take money from your credit card. Year after year, until your card expires and then they send you an invoice. If you want to unsubscribe you first have to pay to do it!!! Unacceptable experience and very poor customer service.
Echoing everyone else's comments this organisation has extremely questionable practices particularly around the auto renewal with the subsequent threat of legal action.This is in breach of the Consumer Rights Act 2015.
Unfortunately, I share the experience of many others. I signed up for Albatross and due to life events, I had to change my credit card. I think I went to two or three events last year and then almost forgot about Internations. I got several emails this year threatening me that if I didn't settle they were able to prosecute. I paid and wrote clearly that that was not the way to keep customers. I have of course changed my membership for the upcoming year to not have to waste money on them again. Very poor treatment of members and I'm quite shocked at the approach.Since I cannot reply to the Internations comment below. It may very well be so, but since I haven't used the page or the service for several months, I had no way of seeing it. Considering my experience and those of many people below (and probably others that haven't posted here), I would recommend that the Albatross is either not an automatically renewed service or that you give an opt out possibility by sending a reminder in time to cancel the rene...
The basic idea of internations is fantastic. The problem is that the business model of internations is based on rip-off. Once you sign-up your membership will automatically charged again after it ended. In addition, they make sure to make it as difficult as possible to cancel your subscription. The option is available on the platform but intentionally hidden. A disgusting view on business ethics, love for its own product and customer respect.
I am this albatross member on Internations. I didnt ever go to any of their event. I just registered at once and it kept renewing itself. I was charged with the total of $78. I changed my cc when they started emailing and threatening me if I dont settle the $26 renewal amount they will escalate it to debt collection agency. I emailed them to cancel the subscription and ask them to remove this charge as I didnt even use their services. Then just see what they responded. What an aweful customer service! Disgrace. I want NO further business w them and want to cancel the subscuption asap (what they dont allow until you dont pay the full price btw)“Internations will not be cancelling your outstanding balance and will take legal actions if you do not pay. We will therefore no longer respond to any further email requesting for this debt to be cancelled.”
"Guys be very careful from this app InterNation!! They have auto subscription and they tried to charge my credit card for a new year without my approval... And am not using this app... Didn't manage to meet anyone from this app... And definitely didn't approve to re charge my card over and over again... Now they are threatened me (didn't manage to get someone to talk to cause their Facebook representative is just saying he is not involved and to write to their support... While their support are sending me these emails with no name... I asked them to call me but no one called... Be VERY careful NOT to use their subscription or giving them your credit card... Cause later on they will charge you and you will not have someone to talk to!:( FINAL WARNING	Gilit,We have repeatedly reminded you that you owe us €71.40 for your Albatross Membership. This payment has been overdue since 30 Jan 2019. As you still have not settled your debt, we are now forced to notify a debt collection agency. This will negatively impac..."
I was charged wrongly! I never wanted to become a membership. They just want to steal peoples money! I ask reimbursement (83 EUROS) but I didnt have any answer!
I was charged  wrongly for another year and the people in the organzation couldn´t give a care. They just want to steal peoples money for an additional year without letting them know in advance.. They are a disgrace and I will be sure to tell everyone I know of what a false company they are. They are a true con company
I've been a happy and loyal member throughout the last five years, from time to time also as a paying member. I just can't understand why people blame a company for their own mistakes: For me, it was totally clear that their business model worked with an auto-renewal and I found it rather easy to cancel the auto-renewal. For other reasons, I also was in contact with their customer care and perceived them to be very helpful and friendly.Please don't be influenced by those angry people and become a member of a very useful active community!
I really enjoyed a couple of their events I went to, for meeting new people, met lots of new friends. I found the bigger events were very segregated to those that had been members for many years, and you just didnt fit in, nor did they want you to fit into their circle. Cause of this I moved away from attending. I tried to see if I needed to do anything under the membership area, but there was nothing I could easily find. I then got scammed by them with them billing my credit card. I wrote and indicated I didnt want to be a member anyway, but they continued to charge me and refused to credit it back. Basically stealing my money and bragging about it. I couldnt easily find how to turn off this autorenewal still... it took me many visits to find it. I find that any institution that bases itself on make money by hiding things, being deceptive, is not the sort of community you want to be involved with anywhere in the world. This issue has now been raised to them directly many times with many people posting com...
InterNations is run by two scumbags, Malte Zeeck and Philipp von Plato (if those are even their real names). You can google them, look at their photos, and instantly understand that they are here to get rich quick by exploiting the naïveté of idealist travelers. They exist to con you out of $99 and have absolutely no desire to ensure customer satisfaction, or resolve complaints. DO NOT JOIN INTERNATIONS!
"BUYER BEWARE and read these reviews!  Do not join this organization.  It has outrageously unethical billing and business practices!  It claims that basic membership in InterNations is ""free"", but then you must pay full-price to attend every single one of their events. If you then upgrade to Albatross membership, which allows you free entry to social functions, it is almost impossible later to cancel your membership.  They give you NO direct Notice when they automatically charge your credit card for their annual fee, and if you object, and state that you no longer wish to be a member (which is why the charge was blocked to begin with), they threaten you with a collection action.  This is an unscrupulous organization, which is all about profit.  Do not be scammed.  BTW, if you're interested in attending one of their events, you can go as a guest, without even risking joining their despicable organization.  You still have to pay (of course; it's all about the $$$), but far better to do it on an event-by-event..."
"I have had the same experience with this excuse off a consumer based company. I never selected to be upgraded and then was automatically charged. I have never used their service nor attended their ""events"". We need to take legal action to prevent them extorting other expats.Their entire practice is against the law and I am actively taking legal action to reclaim this money."
"I only wish I had read the reviews below before ""joining"". I may have inadvertently clicked on the Albatross membership - although after reading the comments below I am not so sure. Anyway, after registering I had a look at the events and the attendees and it seemed to be 90%+ Italians attending events in Milan where we had recently moved. Since I was hoping to meet expats like myself since my Italian was not yet fluent I decided to take my interest no further. I soon received a request for payment informing me I had ""Albatross"" membership. I explained that I had never been to any events or enjoyed any of the supposed benefits of this membership and asked if they could simply cancel the membership. No good, they wanted their cash and couldn't cancel. I suggested paying them half, again explaining that I'd not benefited in any way. No good they wanted their money. Then I started getting the legal, bailiff and credit rating threats. Even though it's hard to believe they would pursue you in court for this sum..."
I joined a free membership and did not click Albatross I believe as I was thinking I don't want to pay even the cheaper fee living on a disability pension. Anyway, just saw I have been charged $83.78 for an albatross subscription. I contacted the company for a refund of course that is not possible, but she suggested I downgrade. She did not explain if basic membership has a fee. OMG I hate being scammed. The only person who contacted me on the site was a scammer. Grew up in France but didn't speak French? (red flag) and worked on an oil rig in Australia which is where I live. Blasted me with compliments. Then he asked what time is it where I am. You're in Australia aren't you? (flag 2) I've heard this scenario before. It's like a script.  I agreed to talk on the phone as I was suspicious. I hope you don't mind my accent he said prior to the call. I don't care about your accent. He calls, he's about 20! His profile picture is of a 60 yr old man. I said I'm very suspicious you sound so young. I've been throu...
They want to squeeze money from people who NEVER use their services. They trick them into a free membership and then impose an automatic renewal system even on those who never used their services/participated in events, and even forgot they'd signed up in the first place. No company that respects and values their audience/customers applies such practice these days. No wonder they're Germans...
Sadly have to add my voice to the huge number of people who have experienced the shockingly poor service that Internations offer.  I also got scammed by their auto renewal, which they fail to inform you of. And when I contacted to complain, they threatened me with legal action and debt collectors knocking on my door!!!  Hardly the response of an organisation that has any ethics or even puts customers first.  I've never used their service so they've been happy to take money for nothing.  Any good organisation that offers a quality service would send details about renewal prior to just taking money.  Don't touch these guys.
They automatically renew premium membership, and it's impossible to cancel. The whole business model is a scam.
Internations is a very diappointing organization that forces people to pay a membership and are only interested in collecting membership fees even though the member has indicated they will not be using the services and wants to delete their account. Very desperate indeed. When the Finance section namely Danielle is only interested in collecting monies in this manner it really brings an organization into disrepute.
As a former Internations Consul in Romania I have to say that I agree with all the people here, in terms of customer service, they are the worse, they have no communication skills and they simply refer you to some FAQ page to get the answers you need. They operate the same way as any other porn site, they give you 2 months free memebership to try it then they charge you 12 months fee. They don't send reminders about the membership renewal although they claim so. Also at their official events, if you just show up, you pay 45 ron (aprox 10 eur) but they don't give a receipt so where do the money dissapear?! That only the Ambassadors could tell because there is no transparency. Also, as a consul, you don't get any support from Internations to organize group events. They simply refer you to some FAQ page. You don't get paid for this although the Consuls are the backbone of this business keeping the communities in action. So at some point after I seen how their HQ reacts to any form of thinking out of the box, ...
I was signed up to Albatross.  At no time did I attend any function.  Decided to not renew but two days late on a proposed 12/12 further membership.  That was six months ago but I continue to receive rather firm threats of legal action. They will be getting nothing more from me.  All this may be legal but says much about their lack of courtesy and professionalism.  I would NOT recommend them to anyone.
"Like many of the other reviews, I have had a horrible experience dealing with the people at InterNations.  I tried to cancel my paid account and couldn't find a SIMPLE Cancel Link and not existed.  I went on google to find out how to cancel.  I followed peoples' directions and still I couldn't find the CANCEL link.  I tried to find a number to call the people in Germany and none existed on their website.  I sent them an email to ask them to cancel and they refused because I was 2 days late.  I see that I am not alone.  They don't care about customers and the customer experience.  The only route they leave for a ""former customer"" is to work through my credit card company."
charged after the trial with no notification prior to this. i think this is the only way they make money as the service doesn't warrant the charge.actually get a response but purely to hide behind terms and conditions.
They charged me $71.20 for a new calendar year subscription after I requested my account to be deleted. They said they could not delete it at this time, and that I had to pay the outstanding balance, despite my explanation that I did not want to be a member any longer. And of course, there are no refunds! Basically, they want me to pay $71.20 for a subscription I do not intend to use. Or in other words, pay $71.20 to have my account deleted.
Poor quality events, and unethical billing procedure which automatically renews and deducts membership money from your account without any notification. They then resort to legal threats even if you say you do not want to renew and have not used any of their products. If you really want to try it out, recommend paying for one-time attendance rather than the Albatross membership which is a colossal waste of money. A company which clearly spends more money on training staff to bully customers and marketing than building networks and holding interesting events (their stated aim).
InterNations is a complete SCAM. What a bunch of lowlife predatory scum. I just like the 94% of reviews that give them 1 star...I was falsely charged for their Albatross membership that I NEVER used. I have never even visited the city that is the base for my membership.SCAMSCAMSCAMI completely refuse to honor your attempt at extorting money from me! I WILL PAY YOU NOTHING!!!!!!!!
I tried for one month the Albatros membeship of Internations for free, to find out that they charged me for one year, without asking me.Now they are harassing me on a daily basis to pay a membership which I do not wish.I authorised them to get paid with my prepaid card and they now want me to make a transfer.I filed already a complaint and I hope that they will stop.
"The organisation is not respectful to its members and rights. They chose auto renewal as a default payment option and try to collect money afterwards. They say “pay your bill or face legal actions”Support function was trained for answering you with a big NO only and there is no other point of contact. They simply try to play with people. Legally no company can chose auto renewal as member’s default preference since it is actually violating the law by intervening your decision making process and compromise your will. Any positive number that needs to be withdrawn by any company should be members decision and they no company can deceive people by using default settings. ILLEGAL!Be away from this companies Albatros membership. This company should have been better; and should have been better on rising its revenues! But they have chosen the easy and ugly way. NOT WISE"
I have the same issues as all of you. My employer paid a one-year membership for me as I moved overseas for the job. Now, after one year, I received an email telling me that my payment is due and if I do not pay, a debit collector will be involved. I actually do not see any benefit in being a member and do not want to continue this membership beyond this one year that was covered by my employer. However, my question would be what can be done now? Anyone having experience with that? Has a collector reached out to anyone?
The way InterNations treat their customers is not only unacceptable, but rises serious concerns over their respect of consumer rights legislation.I'm in the same situation as many of you who have written here: after an automatic renewal of my free month trial, InterNations informs me that I have an outstanding bill of 83€ to settle (they couldn't charge me automatically as my card expired)! I am absolutely shocked, as I have not signed up for an Albatross membership, and never even used their services during the free month trial period. I did not attend any events or post any messages, did not use to the forums or even the Private Messaging system. I wrote to customer service clearly stating that I did not wish to be signed up for an Albatross membership and that I do not wish to continue my subscription at all. I requested their help to delete my account from their website.To which they replied by saying that they cannot do that before I settle the outstanding bill of 83€.This is all very nice, but :1) I ...
In the Internations group I found my future wife and in one month we are waiting for a child. Thank you Internations that you offer the right platform for connecting people.
"I subscribed with Internations for a 1 month free trial, and after that I received an invoice with a yearly subscription fee of over €70, which was quite unexpected from me as I never subscribe for annual memberships, if anything I opt for a monthly plan.. So I requested support from the payments team via email, and I asked them how this amount was charged since I did not receive a confirmation email or receipt from the beginning of my registration (turns out in their Conditions Section 4.4  that ""invoices will not be sent by mail"").The agent who replied has continuously assumed in their email that I want to cancel my account and they cannot do that unless I pay and only then be able to downgrade my membership. As many users here have complained, Internations does not show full transparency in their conduct, payment plan information is hardly to be found anywhere on their site. They should at least inform the subscribed members in advance about which payment plan they have subscribed for. This is very inco..."
I had the same problem. Thank god my card was a debit card that I just used for internet deals. When they tryed to take money from the card there was no money.Now they are threatening me, with a debt collector. I don't intend to pay and I'm going to talk to the police to see what can I do.
Automatically charged me for 1 year worth of subscription after I attempted to cancel the account.  The website was not helpful for meeting people or events and the customer service was horrible.
"So, I received an email from ""Internations Team"" with the subject of ""Legal action impending"". Below is my response to them.Anyone know of a class action to shut down these clowns? I'd love to join. They are clearly in violation of GDPR, apart from their predatory practices arouhd subscription payments.******************************************************My response to Internations follows here:""Hey, so who is this person sending me threatening messages? Can you put a name and signature to your demand so I can see who I need to deal with?You (whoever you are) said:If you do not pay this bill immediately, we will be forced to notify a debt collection agency, which will negatively impact your credit rating.This is a lie. You are not ""forced"" to do anything. You are just being incredibly nasty, for no good reason, in the process hurting your own business. I can't believe you would actually do something like that. Who runs this joke of a business?I must say, I'm incredibly disappointed about the way ""you"" (wh..."
Another horrible experience. Just trying to take your money. Joined and never used it and they automatically renewed it and when I immediately complained and asked for a refund, they said no, it's clear that you wanted to renew because your status is in the app. Then they tell me how to change it and they have buried the controls and made them completely counterintuitive. What kind of organization acts like this? One that is just trying to squeeze money out of you. Also, they allow event organizers on the platform to make money organizing events by working with the restaurants to add a fee to everyone's bill which the organizer then gets as a kickback. Imagine meeting a small group at a restaurant, ordering off the menu-- nothing special-- and then you've go a buck added here and there to items on your bill. When you complain in the comments and reviews of the event, Internations allows the organizer to delete the negative posts so they never show up!!! UNBELIEVABLE!!!!! In BCN, friends of mine know to sta...
Horrible experience on InterNations which volleys as a predatory dating site. My caution is to never post photos or personal data. It was truly a nightmare from beginning to end ridding myself of male members playing the international and local field.
A company who does nothing except take your money! Total scam .....stay away from this organization. If you sign up and give your credit card info they will charge your card without notifying you.....they have soooo much integrity that they put this in their fine print!!!
I've been a member since about 1 1/2 years now and a Consul for close to a year at Internations.org. For those not familiar, a Consul at Internations.org is a voluntary (unpaid) position at a local branch where you moderate an (online) local interest group and organise activities within that interest group. Events is where you meet fellow members. The online part is mainly to find activities/events, but also facilitates discussions to a certain extend. All events in the local branches are organised by volunteers, putting in their spare time to organise something nice for their fellow Internationals.My experiences with the people I meet in real life at Internations events are good. There are nice people, but also people that I like less (like happens in real life).My issue is mainly with how the platform is run from the Headquarters (HQ as they like to call it). Since the livelihood of a local branch relies for 99% on local volunteers organising activities/events in my opinion the HQs business should be foc...
"Unfair commercial practices, non-transparent communication, everything to make it very difficult to get rid of the membership once subscribed. The advantages of the membership are very often overrated or simply fake. One example: an event with free entrance in Brussels is listed on Internations with an entry fee of 10 euro, with a ""reduced"" fee for members of 2 euro. But if you go to the same event without passing via Internations, entrance is free. Good potential material for TV shows like ""On n'est pas des pigeons""..."
"As many of the other members of this site, I was also a victim of the unethical practise and policy of internetions.org. They are asking me to pay over 30 euros for something I was not aware I was scamed to pay for. Clearly, they ""took"" all the steps they need to, not to clearly inform me on time, that if I don't cancel the autorenewal, they will charge me about something I don't need, want and I will not going to use anymore.Even from the beginning they managed to subtly hide the autorenewal informations, subtly enough that you feel comfortable to just klick all the ""next"" buttons until you finish the subscription.At the end, they don't allow me to delete my account until I pay the invoice they sent to me, threathening me that they will take legal actions against me. Not letting me to delete my account is pure kidnapping of the user's privacy!All of the members, or the future members should all be aware that the Internations.org practises are rude, not user friendly and fraudly."
What a con . Tried to auto renew my wife’s albatross membership when it had been cancelled . Threatening legal action now as it was and will not be paid . Absolute discrace .
This company is a joke...just a matter of time till they have to shut down. What goes around comes around! They claim that they comply with all laws and regulations...Yeah! And I am the son from Jennifer Lopez!
Company continued to illegally re-bill credit card for 1 year period without permission for membership. When credit card thankfully expired, company threatened legal collections and legal action in attempt to continue to bill without granted permission.
I registered for the free trial albatroz membership. After the one month trial my credit card would be charged for the full year membership. I haven't logged in after my registration and never attended any event. Forgot completely about it. My credit card expired before the end of the free trial month (it was a 1month 1buy virtual card). They tried to charge the card without success and now I am receiving e-mails threatening that they will take legal action to collect my debt of ~70euros. Why not only cancel the account? Why take this agressive procedure? All the other service companies (LinkedIn, Netflix, Spotify...) just cancel your subscription. I was taken by surprise. I read all the negative comments bellow about the same issue. I will not pay and if necessary I will take this further they need to stop this unethical policy. If someone is also going to fight and not pay please comment, should we go through the European Commission online dispute website?
I wish I have read the Trustpilot reviews before I gave my information to these people!!! I have subscribed for a three month trial for about 15 Euros. Instead of 15 Euros they took 71 Euros from my account for a yearly membership that automatically renews without my knowledge. They do not give you any renewal warning!!!  And it is impossible to cancel your membership! You only see the payment once it has gone out of your account! I only noticed because the second payment did not go through as I have changed my card. Now they are threatening with legal action and debt collection agency!!!! I do not even dare to pay the outstanding balance because than they have the information on my card again, and deduct any amount they see fit. And as I can see from other reviewers they could not cancel their membership even after they paid. I wrote to them several times that I want to cancel my membership but they just keep saying that I should pay first.I am now  sending the email one other reviewer suggested to Intern...
In very short time these founders will have to respond on court. We are working on it. Question of time. Stupid people!!!Never subscribe!!!
InterNations tried to automaticaly renew my albatros membership without inform me. They didn't succeed because my card was blocked and now they are sending me annoying emails threatening legal action. Unbelievable!
"Internations tried to automatically renew my membership without notifying me that it was due for renewal and only contacted me when they had been unable to access my account. I received their e-mail on the day my first year;s membership had expired and immediately contacted them explaining I did not wish to renew. They replied that it was too late and that I could only cancel when I had paid another year's subscription!This happened was three months ago and today I received an e-mail threat that they may resort to a debt collection agency. We shall see - my UK bank thinks their procedure is illegal, but they are a German company and I am a resident of France, so I assume any defensive action I can take will be through EU consumer protection."
Watch out! Internation will reconduct your subscription automatically without previous notification. Even if you ask to discontinue the subscription several times as it is so complicated to do it from their website they will maintain it ! I highly do not recommend you this platform. They are not ethical and will steal your money!!! Run away!
Unbelievably rude customer service and generally not very good service.
Nothing reachable with free membership, impossible to even unsubscribe their newsletter
I was an albatross member for 5 years and a consul for a year. Then my consul membership was revoked without notification. When I reapplied, they asked me what are my plans (they have not changed). When I explained in detail again, they replied with an almost identical set of questions. This went back and forth for about two months: I explain, they send me an identical email, what are my plans. Then they started threatening me with debt collection for unpaid membership. Needless to say, I am extremely disappointed with the management of this organization. They also never provide any disclosure as to how they manage money collected from the albatross membership and from money collected at events from non-members. Their responses never address a specific issue, they are just standard canned formulas. It is really a shame since the concept is great and the local meetings serve a good purpose. I think it is time for someone to investigate this company a bit closer.
This is a deliberate fraud. The company founders have set it up with full knowledge: here are their names Philipp von Plato, Malte Zeeck and Christian LeifeldRip off, automatic charge and renewal without consent...this is a scam and should be stopped
I never wanted to be a paid member. I registered for the basic member for three months. After that they upgraded without me asking or allowing it. They charged me the first time and I didn’t realized. When the it was renewed after three months I asked the cancellation (by law you have seven days to cancel any purchase). They said they wouldn’t refund me and stopped replying. I went public on their Facebook page where other people joined me in the same complain. Now they blocked me there without any response to my messages. Not worth, they are ripping people off
Same experience like everyone else’s here. Just wanted to try the premium membership for a month and now they are threatening with legal actions. I wonder how far can this go? Anyone has heard of an example of someone being suid for really or they are just threatening? This is stressful
"UPDATE:I see that a lot of others have this problem, so I want to share some advice. I just took the following steps, and received written confirmation that they have deleted my account completely.Here's what you do:Send a message to them from their own system, saying the following: Under Article 17 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), you wish to have all personal information they hold on you, including your credit card information, removed from their systems. They have 30 days, by law to comply. If you do not receive written confirmation within 30 days that your information has been deleted, you will report them to the Information Commissioner's Office, who may then fine them up to 20 million EUR or 4% of their turnover, whichever is greater.I did this, and received written confirmation that they had deleted my account. It's nice to see these scumbags play ball for a change.Also, if you go to the Internations homepage, scroll to the bottom, and click the small link that says ""Team"", you can ..."
Never ever pay these as*holes for an Albatros membership, they will automatically renew it after 1 year, and they don't give you the possibility to cancel the membership, it's like a lifetime membership. They will say that you can cancel before expiring the current one, and so I did one month before, but they delayed the process so much that now they, the period has ended and they threaten me with legal actions if I don't pay. I won't pay anything scumbags !!I can't post reviews with links but :Go to a site where you can make a formal complaint to the European commision if many of us do this they will be forced for setting reminders and behave more decently with their customers :www europa eu/customers /online Look for the section Online Dispute Resolution
This is a scumbag company.  Avoid them at all cost.  They should be put in jail in my opinion.
So I just let them bully me into paying for another year of the Albatross membership. I have the same complaints as everyone who wrote before me. I originally subscribed because I thought it would be a great idea for networking (silly me) Turns out it's nothing but a meat market and I paid idi*t tax because I'm too scared to have my credit score hit. For those of you with the same problem, immediately downgrade your membership after paying the outstanding invoice! Or delete your account which I'm not yet sure how to do. I plan on showing up to events and just drinking the free welcome drink (and then leaving again) until I've made up for the 70€ haha!
Being regular (not an albatros tho) member for over 2 years. This is probably the worst social service. I am also consul, organizer. I explained a few times with arguments why their service sucks so much, but they always outsmart me & everyone else with pointless replies. I am amazed how come they are still in business. Probably scamming people with the albatros yrly subscription is working just fine as I read through the ratings.
If you are thinking about joining this website to find friends, please don't. They tell you that you can join up and become an Albatross member for a year, then they automatically renew your membership, When you inform them you do not want to renew it, then they tell you after the renew date that it has automatically renewed and you have to pay for another year. Then they threaten you with debt collection agencies, solicitors, courts and all kinds of threatning letters. They will not remove your data from the sight, even when you tell them to do it. I had all kinds of strange people contact me on this site, asked for them to remove my data and they refused, instead sending me threatning letters that I am a member and have to pay. Please don't get caught out by these con artists. Think before you join and you never get anything from this site except trouble.
They took my money and they did't even renew my account ver bad application and spam
Very disappointing and frustrating experience. I just can confirm all what was written below, nothing changed or improved. Difficult to believe that nowadays, when all service providers around the world are implementing innovative products to improve client experience, such a low quality trite offer still exist. But, as we know, similar attracts similar. Think well before enrolling into InterNations community!
THEY ARE SCAMMERS AND ARE THREATENING ME WITH LEGAL ACTION IF I DON'T PAY THE SUBSCRIPTION. I AM REFUSING TO PAY BECAUSE I IMMEDIATELY REALIZED IT WAS A DISGUISED DATING SITE, NOT WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO BUTTON TO CANCEL THE SUBSCRIPTION DURING THE TRIAL PERIOD. THEREFORE, THEY INVOICED ME AND ARE NOW TRYING TO ENFORCE THE PAYMENT ON ME. SCAMMERS, SHAMEFUL SCAMMERS. THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE. DO NOT SUBSCRIBE FOR NO REASON!!!!!!!!!P.S.YOUR REPLIES ARE JUST A BUNCH OF LIES. THERE IS NO BUTTON TO DOWNGRADE. THE INTERFACE IS DESIGNED WITHOUT THAT BUTTON SO THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DOWNGRADE DURING THE TRIAL PERIOD.NOW I AM GOING TO TAKE LEGAL ACTION TO STOP YOU STALKING ME WITH YOUR THREATS.
I think it really depends on the community you visit or live in. It's a great way to meet fellow global minds in your home city, and when traveling. The Consul activities are the opportunity to get to know people, because the groups are smaller, and organized around a fun activity (theater? Live music? etc ) or concept (Italian speakers, Eastern Europeans, etc). The annual membership is quite affordable, especially when you consider that you have access to the smaller group events, as well as the events in other cities when your travel. The communities are run by volunteers, so every community is a bit different and depends on how engaged the Ambassadors are. The down side is that membership is automatically renewed and HQ is not particularly responsive to those who want to cancel.I'm the spirit of full disclosure, I've been a member for 3 years and became an organiser 1 year ago. Upset people are more likely to post reviews, and the membership frustration is understandable/justified, but I really think th...
Internations have an auto renew policy on a 6 monthly basis with a built in price increase.   This is not evident when signing up.  I don’t recall reminders before payment was removed (or attempted) but they become extremely aggressive as soon as payment fails.    There is no way to back out of this renewal despite no use of the product.  The events are essentially dating events, which is not what I was looking for at all.
SAD experience with that community. I hardly recommend not to accept the offer they constantly do to 1 month upgrade to ALBATROS membership for free. No sense. NEVER give them your CREDIT card information. If you did it, downgrade and remove your card info. Lack of ethics, lack of communication, lack of customer service, rude treatment, a clear violation of online e-commerce codes. A shame to hold the .ORG status.
very difficult to leave their loving tentacles.... the Albatros option offered little of extra value to me, and most events were either free to everyone, or the same price... so i tried to downgrade... each time proved a maze... in the end i paid three annual subscriptions before i took enough time to make a concerted effort and much google searching to figure it out... They now tell me I won't be charged again, but there is a mountain of evidence that others have not been set free in this way.... It seems amazing that a big entity should need to make things so obscure to wheedle extra, unwanted subscriptions out of people
Customer service is a joke. Quality assurance team is rude. They have even organized events in Germany where German people are not allowed to go,. Which is illegal, by the way. Unbelievable. Never, NEVER give them your credit card number. They will try to steal your money for years. They will ignore your emails, faxes and will send lawyers against you. It is a nightmare.
Same issue as everyone else. Automatic subscription without notification. My subscription fee was also increased without prior notification. When i try to cancel my membership the customer service team were extremely rude and immediately threatened me with debt collection etc. Cant believe companies are still acting this way in the era of reviews and online feedback.
Thanking my expired credit card, they immediatly wrote me that it was the moment to pay again my Albatros Membership, and that I have to give them a new credit card data, because they were unable to charge the money.So, in that moment I discoverd that they charged my credit card more times in the past, without any notification before and after it. I immediatly wrote them that I don't want to be a member anymore, so, I will not pay. And they wrote me again that they will proced through a debt collection agency.WHAT?1 -  The EUROPEAN LAW provides some mandatory steps, such as: the formal collection of complaints and the attempt to negotiate and settle the dispute before proceeding by legal action (as the EU office just wrote to me)2 - Every online company sends more email advance deadline notices, even clearly explaining the procedure to close the automatic payment. Plus send email note after charged the credit card.3 - In any case, every online company, if the client doesn't pay anymore, just closes the ser...
"Very bad unsubscribed practices and refund policy not existant .The ""club is run by locals which is  generally expats lonely and helpful but this GERMAN BASED ORGANISATION , itself has some issues with the Albatross membership .

Luckily I have not been charged with money, but if someone is planning an action against harassment, please count me in. I have tried to unsubscribe in any way and they keep contacting me. I don't want to be involved with InterNations. Kind regards

Hello everybody,I think we need to make a group action. I have the same case.. as my CC expired they couldn't take the automatic payment and threatening that they will send the Debt Collector and I will get charge also for this service. I checked all the issue.. by goggling Albatross membership.. and I could saw many posting since 2011 from different cities in every nations complaining about his kind of business practice. But if only one by one person speak out in different media.. no changes will happened in the future. Many people will get the same trick in the future. We need to make it viral in social media like FB and share or we make a collective report. You could send your report to yennylukes et yahoodotcom.
"Agree with previous comments. Even Apple and Microsoft send you an email, before they take any money. Fortunately by credit card had expired so they couldn't take payment but I can see they are likely to threaten. Has anyone ever been taken to court by them for payment of ""invoices""? It's hard to think how they would - I'm currently in Middle East and they don't know my address here or in my home country."
SCAM SCAM SCAMThey are threatning people to pay otherwise they proceed with legal action... Leave them immediately
Have the same terrible experience if imposing the invoice, threatening, rudenesd, etc. Could not find here how to contact the same victims with similar stories and willing to claim and take legal actions.  In any case, I'm ready to take actions.
DO NOT JOIN THIS MEMBERSHIPThey are not interested in helping expats acclimatise to life in a new country, they are just looking for your money. Signed up to what I thought was a year of membership, ended up not using it. Turns out there is smallprint in their Ts&Cs where it automatically renews for another year unless you actively cancel it. Contacted customer service to explain the issue, they hounded me with debt collection notices until I paid for another year of membership they know I will not use. If they check their records, I have clearly not been using their product. Happy to share screenshots from customer service department, they were rude, offensive and thoroughly unpleasant. Very unethical. Posting my experiences to hopefully prevent others from going through this horrible ordeal when trying to build a life in another country.
Ridiculous platform.  Automatically renews membership. You can cancel any other serious subscription (Skype, even Prime if you don't use it) but not a social-media like platform. Are you for real?Promoted as a platform to help expats settle and network. Bull**it.Threaten to escalate to a debit collection agency if not paid balance. I really hope they have a signed contract in that case.Specifically said I want to delete account and do not want them/agree with to keep my information on their site. I hope they have really good GDPRs
very bad company, dont subcribe for free trial
This is a worst site. who charged my card even after I deleted my account. total scam, I am emailing them however they said they can not refund.I am scared to realize that they will keep applying charges to my account
They Scam people. They make it super confusing to cancel, they don't reply to e-mails and then charge you a early fee.
I wish I could give less than one star.  As with everyone, I tried to cancel before my year paid membership was up, but the process was confusing so I messaged them asking for help with canceling.  I didn't receive a response and instead was automatically renewed.  I have refused to pay, and have even gone as far to contacting the owners to explain the situation, I am continue to receiving threatening and harassing messages.  Someone on here mentioned filing a small claims suit and I would definitely agree with bringing that about.  Please contact me if someone decides to file the claim.
"I had to relocate from Manila months ago and am no longer part of this community. I tried to cancel this membership unsuccessfully due to the designed cumbersome nature of opting out of a paid membership. They will not help you or refund your money. The administration is trash. Cancel any premium membership immediately.This is the instructions I received from Internations when requesting a refund. I'm not sure if they actually work:1. Log into InterNations and go to your profile, click on the “More” button and then click on Login & Basic data. Scroll down.2. Click or tap on “Change membership” and then on ""No, thanks"".3. Check your reasons for downgrading and enter your password.4. Press “Downgrade” to avoid any further automatic renewals."
"Sadly I also fell for the ""automatic payment"" scam, followed by the threats and intimidatory tactics used by this truly appalling organisation. My experience is the same as hundreds of others on this site, how many victims does it take for the German/EU authorities to step in and do something about their scammer-style business practices? Just because the contractual fine print makes it legal (in Germany) doesn't mean it's morally or ethically acceptable."
very unreasonable and they cheat you out of money using fine print. Never sign up for paid membership - trust me you will not get any value for your money anyways.
Automatically charged me for a year after the trial membership ended. I tried to cancel immediately but they refused to refund the money. I thought it would renew at the most for 1 month not an entire year. Of course they let me cancel my membership so no membership yet it’s paid for the year. Scam!!!!
Do not ever never sign up for that! Problems started from the moment I signed up and the credit card was charged while it was supposed to be a free trial. It’s a scam !!!!
Purely political and behind the scene. The site further doesnt recognize Palestine as a country but goes with what the scandalous UN lists.I feel that this group was created for political reasons that most governments are unaware of.
"Can they really do that?I have never had such a terrible experience. In the last email they are threatening with the debt collecting agency. Can they really do that? I mean, I have not yet heard of an online platform that is going to start a legal process of any kind to collect the membership fee. (My debit card is canceled meanwhile and. They were not able to charge anything)Also I am not able to access the account - meaning, hypothetically if I leave it for a year now they will ""charge"" the next year too? This is outrageous."
This business is a scam that requires a credit card for registration for a free of charge service but then starts charging fees without customer's authorization. If one wants to cancel the account, you are forced to pay the exorbitant fee of £90 to regain access to the account. They send threatening emails suggesting your credit rating will be impacted if you don't pay their invoice for a service you have never used. This is outrageous. They not only do not allow me to remove my account, they are also using my personal data without authorisation and forcing customers to pay fees in order for our data to be removed from their website.
As I'm also a victim of this scam - We are too many people here to have been scamed by this fake company. Lets launch a class auction lawsuit.It s free we just need your testimony and will contact the German Public Prosecutor. irlorilo at gmail.com
Very bad company. I have removed my credit card info before the renewal date since I don´t want to continue with their membership and now they are forcing me to pay.I have just checked my emails and saw a warning sent by internations saying :As you still have not settled your debt, we are now forced to notify a debt collection agency. This will negatively impact your credit rating and result in additional fees for you.However, if you pay your outstanding balance of €71.40 within the next 24 hours, we will clear your debt and cancel all legal action. Did anyone reach this level with them? Any advice?I read in the thread below that we should contact the European Consumer Centre. Looking forward for some help :)!
No way to cancel the paid membership on the membership page. The service after emailing them was them just outlining their rules. They are just after your money and not interested in you as a satisfied customer. Really a shame since their concept is quite promising.
"Hello All,Stay away - something is clearly not right with this company.  I can confirm the grievances regarding auto-renewal without notice others have documented would be genuine.If I could give a negative star I would. .  I had not made any use of my Albatross Membership and when my card expired, they auto-renewed without warning and invoiced me.  When I challenged the bill, they pointed to their ""Terms and Conditions"" and an argument resulted to which they made similar legal threats.  The representative probably has a threatening email template setup to fire off when someone complains.In the end, I paid and am going to dispute with credit card company and I am confident they will side with myself.  I let them know not to come after me or I will seek a class action.  I have also filed a complaint with econsumer site as well. At best, their business practice in unethical and questionable.  I am not a lawyer so I am not certain if it is illegal, though it appears to be the case.   Their approach with billi..."
It seemed like a good organization at first, but BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT PAID MEMBERSHIP.I paid for an Albatross membership, and did not realize they will bill your credit card every year, without sending you a notice that they will do so prior to billing.I had not been using the organization, for two year and was billed without realizing. Okay, my bad. However, when my credit card number changed, they issued a membership again, without asking me first.I immediately asked them to cancel my membership, but they refused and said I could only cancel, after first paying (no refund of course). They refused to have any person that i could speak to on the phone, and said they would call collections.Don’t be scammed like this. If you join then do not give them your credit card information. Stick with a free membership is best.
"Internations - Corporate bullies! You have to sign up with a compulsory membership renewal and if you don’t go and change it they will send you a renewal invoice and threaten legal action if you don’t pay it. Very heavy handed; not customer friendly #internationsbullies"
Just awful!!!! They treaten with leagal action if your payment doesn’t go through!!!!! And the payment is done upfront!!! So they treaten you wigh kegal action for a payment for a service you didn’t even use yet!!!!!!
DO NOT Register to this organisation at all! I was a member of InterNations group for the last 1 year, I have registered to several events but mostly they are time wasting.NO HELPFUL CUSTOMER SERVICERUNNING AFTER YOUR MONEY - if you are fool enough (like me) to register as an Ambassador Member they will secure your card details and repetitively charge it with NO notification or CONSENT.I am going to seek for legal advice as they are breaching the UK and EU laws.DISGUSTING MENTALLY.I will edit my review with full experience i have had so far however, I am on the process of taking a legal action, once its over I will write down the full process and the way how these guys work.STAY AWAY!!!
Overpriced so called international network with malfunctioning simple website. The only thing they know to do well is to take your money and, in contrary to normal professional companies, to keep it even if you are unhappy with their service and just paid (less than one hour before) for another not used 3 months period.
WOW - After reading everyone else reviews it is clear that i am not the only one. Disgusting scam and they should held accountable.all they want is money and wont let you cancel without paying.AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE.worst mistake ever. Pretty obvious the website is filled with Bot accounts winking at you to keep you entertained (although this isnt illegal and i cant prove it) it is still shameful.
Purely an 'Unethical and Unprofessional' company. Renewed my membership without even seeking my consent or even notifying me. So I asked for refund which was refused. Rationale given by them, their T&C allows them to charge renewal fee without notifying the member. In my opinion this is unethical.If PayPal had not notified me, I would have had no clue about the charge on my card. Thanks to PayPal. Else these guys would continue to charge and I wouldn't know. They just charge money on your account and let their members figure it out themselves. My question is, why wouldn't you as an organization notify your member about the coming up charge? What's wrong with that? They said nothing. What I found most unprofessional is, when they said they are in their legal limits to charge a credit card and not notify their member. Its part of their lengthy T&C. Which only tells me that they have protected themselves legally to make unauthorized payments on their members credit card / PayPal. Charging money silently witho...
Michael Lock a representative of this low level company internations tell that they will contact the lawer and all this stuff. They need a money. Great if all people can know about that. This platform is old , it is really no usable. Generally this group is haven't a sense , there is no so much people, it's looking fewer.Their customers will soon say enough  and leave. I don't want to pay for the Auto Renewal.
"I subscribed for the Albatross membership without knowing about automatic renewal. I never attended any even after an initial one, so in the first year I barely used the (little) advantages of that. The second year, I completely forgot about it, but they of course charged my cc. In the meanwhile that cc expired and in occasion of the 3rd renewal, they started to write to me an outstanding balance to pay. I wrote a number of times to them to explain I was not interested anymore in the Albatross membership, but there was no way to convince them to cancel the charge, which by the way is for a service not used yet nor in my intention to use. They start to harass me with increasingly threatening emails to pay, to the point to threat to ""notify to a debt collection agency which will negatively impact my credit rating"". Since luckly in EU there are very precise laws in this matter to protect the consumer from this type of situations (automatic renewal is forbidden if not asked explictly by the customer), it is cl..."
Boring, false and even not safe website ! They are just interested to grab money and strike you like you are a child. People are the members for years !! attending many useless events  in there and still alone ((( what does it say about?
InterNations - If you don't have much luck on Tinder, check out InterNations!All events are generally full of lonely old men/women looking to bed the newest member, do not think for one second that this is a viable option to make business contacts or meet like minded people... you'll very quickly notice the majority of people there are your local swingers and the management of the website/payment system is despicable.The german InterNations team resembles a dictatorship and you'll most likely notice they'll be trying to take your money even after you've cancelled your membership... this is a bad company doing bad business... if your looking to meet people, use LinkedIn or look for facebook groups in your new country (you'll find this to be 100x more beneficial than wasting 60$ on InterNations to meet the local reprobates). Overall - bad company / bad management / no morals... 0/10
"- I sent a request to join them after clearly answering all their questions, and they replied that my membership has been declined. When I asked about the reason, they not only didn't tell me the exact reason, but also their email was full of offensive words showing superiority. They said that I need to  ""GET THEIR ATTENTION"" so that they accept my application, and to get their attention, I should give them a ""CONVINCING REASON"" explaining why I want to join them, although I had clearly mentioned that I want to join because I need some advices from people about moving to Europe. They also said that I make sure my application is filled out in ""PROPER ENGLISH"", although I already wrote in english. There are lots of people who don't know english or whose english is weak, and this would be very disrespectful to them. And when they call themselves an ""INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY"", at least they should prove that and show respect to all the nations. Also they told me that they will give me ""ANOTHER CHANCE"" to join t..."
"BEWARE AND STEER CLEAR!!!This company is a bunch of rip off artists.I absolutely agree with all the other reviews, this company is one BIG rip off. if they havent sucked you into a one year membership with their one month ""FREE"" trial, steer way clear. they do it with impunity, I paid through Paypal and still couldnt get my money back, They claim they deducted the money at exactly 30 days, it was actually 29 days and since then I have written back and forth and they are adamant in their refusal. They can hide in germany but they are promoting business in our town. We should all submit a complaint to a consumer protection authority and turn up the heat.BAD NEWS $83 down the drain for absolutely nothing and very rude to work with"
"DISGUSTING DISGUSTING COMPANY!!!I've used Internations in about a dozen countries and their parties are typically filled with CREEPY RACIST MEN. GROSS CLIENTELE. GROSS BUSINESS MODEL. When I brought this to their attention, all they did was message me about how I supposedly missed a payment. I told them their membership is bulls*** and that their clients are racists bigots and they have an archaic business model. They keep sending me invoices. They never addressed ANY of the issuesTHE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE IN EXISTENCE! So they built a business based on ""uniting people"" yet they have no people sense whatsoever!!!! HEARTLESS. DISGUSTING. DON'T JOIN THIS CRAP."
Original review (28th July 2018)I am bitterly disappointed with the service that I have received from this company. To cut a long story short, I had an Albatross membership. I realised quickly that I didn't attend many events and the ones I did attend weren't really worth the annual payment. I received notification that my payment was automatically renewed but that they were not able to deduct from my account. Therefore I was sent an invoice and asked to settle the balance as soon as possible. I got back to them within 2 days stating that I didn't want the membership  and to cancel the renewal. They have said that the renewal has already been made and that I must pay anyway. I have gone back and forth and been referred to the Terms and conditions on countless occasions. I have asked for the company to explain where it says that I cannot cancel an automatic renewal, or where the 14 day cooling off period does not apply. So far they have been unwilling to do this. Now the finance department (someone called D...
Agree with many of the other reviews on here that unfortunately the service is set up to rinse you of cash. The gatekeeping is steep and unwarranted.There are much better ways to go out and meet people for real. This service is based around charging you to join other chargeable events and I think it's misleading to tout that as being a community.
I had an Albatross membership (which I didn't realize autorenewed). So the ba***ds are sending me emails threatening to call in a collection agency. I have lots of free time in hand and would love to see this go to court. Misrepresentations, fraud and a totally deceiving customer service are some traits they represent.....a bit like Angela Merkel's Germany where they are located. No wonder Trump is screwing Germany (though I am not a Trump fan!). And we all know how they are trying to screw Great Britain with the Brexit deal. Bunch of malicious, malignant and misrepresenting crooks! Not to mention it is a totally useless service as most of the members there are stuck up individuals who are happy to be in their own circle of friends and are so nostalgic about their home countries.
About a year ago and joined InterNations. They charged but I never ended up using the service. They have only just got in touch with me three weeks ago and said I owe them for the renewal payment (I changed my bank details last year, so they were not able to debit my account).They have persistently been chasing, saying they have a clause that states if you do not cancel your renewal after 14 days, you will automatically be charged. There was no reminder to my personal email nor the email on the site that the renewal is due. They claimed they do not send this out, so members to do not lose out on opportunities. However, it has become apparent that this a deliberate act to continue to exploit consumers for more payments.I cannot cancel my membership and they are threatening to continue keeping my account open and charge for every period until I do. They have also said they will use debt collectors and I will incur further costs if I refuse. I certainly won't be a returning customer, they ensured that by thei...
They create a dark pattern where it is really easy to accidentally pay for a full membership after your free trial is complete. They will charge you even if you are a day late canceling and have zero interest in helping you out. It is impossible to get any kind of refund since they charge you everything upfront and not month to month like most subscription services. While what they are doing is completely legal, it is clearly done purposely and dishonestly to scam you out of your money since you can read all over the internet of people bringing up the exact same complaint. I have learned my very expensive lesson and am posting my story anywhere I can so that other do not fall into the same trap.
"This company is a Fraud. I had set up a reminder on my calendar to cancel the membership after my free trial. However, I the cancellation button was in a very unlogical location; therefore I had to contact the client service, requesting them to cancel my membership. They got back to me two days later with the instructions, just after I had paid for my first month.Don't bother with that company their only way to make money is to trick people who registered to the free trial. They are awful."
"Do not be a member! This is fraud!! Do not give your credit card details!I signed up when I moved to UK thinking it would help me socialize.I did not use it at all.I was not aware of the automatic renewal service.They charge me for their stupid service which I haven't even used.They never emailed me about this but then all of a sudden I get this threatening email:""Fees of €41.70 for your Albatross Membership have remained unpaid since 16 May 2018. You have been notified of these outstanding charges both on our website and three times by email.Please settle this charge immediately — if this bill remains unpaid, we reserve the right to use a debt collection agency which may incur additional costs.""I have not been notified at all!and this threatening tone of voice in the email is very rude and unfair."
Horrendous group. Save yourself the money and don't subscribe.I stupidly signed up, all I got was spam. I said I was moving to Germany and would like to connect with local German groups and they responded by saying no, I should connect with groups in my area.How would they possibly know what is best for me.Anyway I forgot about this useless money grabbing group and found other free wonderful groups who are really there to connect you to other people.I then got an e-mail threatening me with legal action if I didn't pay the following year's subscription.Something that I hadn't used for a year which was useless. I responded that I didn't want to be a member and wasn't sent a reminder. They didn't care and quoted some obscure clause in their terms where they can charge you regardless.I then tried to delete my account and they disabled the link for me to do it.So I am left with an account I cannot delete and legal action against me for absolutely nothing!They can clearly see I have not been active in their grou...
I applied for this in Athens as I was on my own & hoped to find other expats which did not work out so I unsubsidised 3 times and am still getting e-mails grrrr so totally annoying PLEASE STOP SENDING! I am not intetested!
If you are in any kind of management position or an executive / investor please don't share any contact details on Internations. They sell out your information to insurance companies and brokers. Just a day after I joined I started to get annoying calls from all these companies. When I blocked them on my phone they started emailing me. When I blocked them there, they called to my office. They wouldn't tell me where they got my contact info but I strongly suspect it was Inter-nations. Just a fair warning before you use this site. And also if you have done your research .. DO NOT PAY THEM, DO NOT LET THEM GET YOUR CREDIT CARD DETAILS!  They will force you to cancel it because they will not stop charging you.
InterNations are con artists - the whole business is a ruse to get your card details and hope you forget to cancel. I have had the same experience as other users here, being threatened with legal action for an “unpaid invoice” for Albatross membership  (which basically is required to use anything or attend any events). I explained I hadn’t had an email warning about the pending payment, didn’t want or use the service, and would like it cancelled. But now they threaten to come after me with a debt collection agency for the full bill for a year. The relevant clause is buried deep in the T&C and not even clear. They communicate via their internal inbox, which you obviously won’t see if you don’t use the site. It is almost like some kind of joke - but they appear to be serious and are refusing to close my account. I’m quite sure the practices fall foul of consumer protection law in most countries and - despite the monumental waste of time given the small sum involved - I intend to report them on principle. In ...
If only I had read these reviews before joining - absolutely awful, horrible and unacceptable customer service - everything written below about their automatic renewal policy is true. Clearly this is their money making scheme - as no one in their right mind would continue to log in to their InterNations account after attending more than one or 2 events, awful places that were worse than my most horrible frat party experiences in college. I will be curious to follow the police investigation mentioned in one of the reviews as I will now pursue filing a legal case against them. Shocked and troubled. Absolutely, do not join InterNations.
Awful events, horrible customer service and they have unscrupulous auto-renewal policies.  Without warning they tried to charge an expired card, now they claim I owe them 40 dollars and refuse to close my account.  Avoid at all costs.
Exactly the same issues with renewing membership that previous posters have identified. Despite numerous emails asking them to delete my account and explaining I no longer wanted membership they charged a full year and started threatening me if I didn't pay. Finally had to pay up as heavily pregnant and couldn't cope with the stress. DO NOT SIGN UP - I found the service rubbish and it is much better to just use free facebook groups. Hopefully I will have saved some of you future problems with this terrible company.
I signed up for an Albatross membership at Internations about 1.5 years ago. I used it for the first few months and then stopped using it. I paid without a problem. Unfortunately I did not use over the last several months (basically since last time it was renewed) and I did not log in onto the website, so I did not see any message to remind me the renewal of the subscription was about to happen. I also did not receive an email warning me about the renewal that was about to happen. To my surprise, they sent me an email a few days ago, informing me that they needed my new credit card details (I had changed my credit card over those months) to pay the outstanding balance because they had automatically renewed my membership! I sent them a very polite email explaining that I had not used my Internations profile or subscription since my last renewal and if they could please downgrade my status to basic status. Their response was no. I needed to pay the balance, since I had not downgraded prior to the renewal dat...
"Last year I signed up to internations with Albatros membership. First of all fees are high since in return you are not able to get any benefit especially if you are living Turkey. Because I have lived in UK for 5 years and half a year in Belgium they do not consider me expat since I complete my membership for Turkey and I am Turkish.. It is nearly impossible to meet any global minds because there are hidden events called ""expat only events"" and if you do not have double flag in your profile (having a nationality different from where you live currently) you cant even see those events. That means they would accept member from harmful communities like terrorists (coz they could have passport other than TR but they will not accept you into expat events coz you have TR passport) funny enough they will still ask you to pay for full membership... Internations.org is a fully discriminating organisation claiming to be international! This is just a big lie.."
I signed up for premium membership at Internations for a year. Unfortunately I did not use it and assumed it would finish at the end of the term. To my surprise, they sent me a letter at the end of the year, informing me that they needed my new credit card details (i changed the card) to automatically renew my membership! When I signed up for a year, there was no message about auto renewal! Turns out, it is in small print in their terms and conditions!!! I wrote to them, saying ok, I will pay for 1 month, but they want the whole year!!!!! That is totality unacceptable from a Company that claims its aim is to help people!
DO NOT SHARE ANY PERSONAL DETAILS WITH THESE PEOPLE.  I had my bank account robbed by someone who worked at this company.They ask for highly personal details saying they want to verify your identity and then these details end up in the hands of fraudsters.  I am a model and I saw my picture from my ID used on another site.  These guys are the only ones that I sent a copy of my ID to.BE VERY CAREFUL. Your data and information is not safe with these people.  My credit card that I used to pay for the trial membership was hacked, my bank account was hacked. And it all happen only a day or so after I gave these people my ID.  Some of the information that the fraudsters had was only given to Internations and no body else.The police said that they had received numerous reports about Internations and were investigating them in more detail.  It took me weeks and weeks and hours of my time to get all this sorted out.  I feel that I had my very identity violated by these people. I thought they were a reputable compan...
"A rip off : Hidden automatic renewal.I paid for a 3 months trial, after 3 months I am billed for another 3 months with absolutely no warning (no email, no text, nothing), because there seems to be an ""automatic renewal"".that one was hidden in the small letters of terms and conditions. I went to one activity, once, and now I pay another 3 months I never wanted... and guess what? they refuse to refund me ! they say I should have read the conditions. how can this be legal?after having read other comments on internet It seems to be common practice for Intenations to sneak charges on a yearly bases based on their auto renewal policy which is created “for the convenience” of the members. I truly hope that someday they will deal with a class action suit."
"Internations.org was the most disappointing experience I had with a 'club'. Normally a club ensures democratic rights for members (as required by law in eg. Netherlands), but not internations. Disadvantages of the organisation:- led by 'communications people' not slightly aware of psychological science and practice (being PhD psychologist I can judge)- communications are steered by 24 year old interns; they give 'advice' to members twice as old with 10x as much education- one can be very suddenly 'ex-communicated' without reason - this happens very often, they refer to 'internal guidelines' that make possible to throw out anybody the leaders (Malte Zeeck) dislikes- very misleading in terms of 'membership': Dutch law allow the term 'membership' only when members have rights to vote, when it is a democracy.- the person of leader Malte Zeeck: a communications background; in my view totally driven by money making. As assessment psychologist I dare to say he lacks 'warmth' and love, a capability of 'authentic f..."
I agree with the previous commenters about Internation's horrible/fradulent policy and customer service. I moved back home because of COVID so was no longer an expat. When my Albatross membership due came up I never received any notification (they will keep giving you the same response of how you could have checked on your profile page and the process is super easy). When i inform that I will no longer be needing the service a day after my membership was charged (this was promptly sent to me) I informed them that I will no longer be using the service and please either downgrade or cancel my account as now I couldn't do it from the page. After that - as the others mentioned, NON-STOP email threatening, chasing, for legal action, debt collection....IS THIS WHAT I SIGNED UP FOR THE WHOLE TIME? Yes, you can blame this all on your policy and that this is legal under German law (to I suppose threaten your customer when they've claimed they no longer wish to do business with you). What horrible practice - for jus...
It was a long time since i had not renew my internations albatross membership, because i was relocated. When i returned and paid my old time balance they gave me complimentary a 3 months membership! I do appreciate it, especially these days, that we have more the need to share, communicate, exchange feelings and ideas through the computer.
Got to realize they were collecting money without notification when the payment was rejected due to credit card expiration. Despite a direct email informing Internations I was not interested in extending the membership they keep harassing me with threatening messages. Such attitude besides being irespectful is totally unacceptable in today's world. As much as I supported the concept since its inception I believe such a business model is appalling and should be condemned. People, don't ever give away your credit card details to Mr Zeeke.
Whatever you do, make sure to give them no credit card details as they will scam you- They took payment and then wrote to me threatening legal action and demanding payment (which is what alerted me to the fact that they had as I checked my account). This company is a scam, pure and simple. I struggle to believe that the employees are able to sleep at night knowing what they are part of. Sickening.
This site is wonderful it allows you to connect with expats in your country and global minds abroad your country .. I recommend you use this app it is amazing It is a great community to gather together And it is good if you want to travel abroad so you can connect with global minds people to provide you with information and make new friends and much more 😊I can simply say this app is the best 👍
Dear Scammed Members,Thank you for submitting your feedback and for sharing your concerns with us that we don't care about, therefore we hire students to reply to each review with one of our canned answers. You probably know all of these answers already, as the mentioned issues have not been addressed since years on purpose. It was easier for us to develop boring template answers than to be fair and ethical to our members.Kindly be informed that we operate on an automatic renewal system which enables us a more convenient usage of our members' credit card data (= charging it without prior notification & not allowing them to delete this data), making sure that they do not miss out on writing negative reviews or complain about how we are unable to offer any premium features of Albatross Membership during a world pandemic & lock-down. This old trick still works well.We don't bother with informing any of our members when their Albatross Membership subscription will get renewed automatically and we charge them f...
Great to meet people from different heritage!
"I signed up for a FREE trial, unfortunately, a day after we were announced a total lockdown in Paris, therefore I was unable to profit from my membership, or use the platform for anything. Few days ago I got a pending transaction on my account - Internations is charging me 80.17 euro for THE WHOLE YEAR of membership. I thought this could be easily solved, similar like let's say ""Amazon Prime"" with who I was able to get the money back for a subscription that I was not really interested in. I locked my card and I contacted them immediately. But, to my absolute surprise, the answer was negative: ""we will not issue a refund"". I am still fighting and refuse to pay upfront for a year of subscription for something I am not even interested in. I consider this kind of ""trick"" as a highly fraudulent, and won't rest until they stop scamming people into unwanted memberships. If you are interested, contact me, together we can file a proper complaint, and expose Internations for what it really is - huge money scammer !"
I would give 0 star if I could. WORST company ever, unethical and useless customer service. Been charged for a membership I never agreed to and I can see I'm not the only one.DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR CARD DETAILS.Update after Internations replied: thanks but no thanks for your reply, you are a total fraud. Seeing the number of unsatisfied customers and you act like everything is fine, Shame on you for taking people money in such a dishonest way!!
I joined InterNations last year and upgraded to an Albatross membership for one year to try it out. I was not aware that the membership fee is set to auto renew and that there is no choice to opt out. Unlike other companies and organisations that behave ethically and send reminders to customers, InterNations did not send a reminder email that my membership would be auto renewed.  If I had known about the auto renewal with no option to opt-out, I would not have have upgraded my membership at all. The advertised benefits and terms of the membership are misleading and not made clear from the outset preying on unwary expats who are seeking assistance with settling in to their new countries of residence.  I only discovered this when InterNations recently tried to auto renew my membership and there was an issue with payment. I have since received threatening letters from InterNations that they will sell my debt to a debt collection agency. I did not expressly or knowingly agree to the auto renew or to have a fur...
I was a few hours too late to cancel after a 30 day trial. I contacted them right away, and they refused to refund. I think they only make money from people like me.  I don't see how will get any benefit from this organization at all. I googled InterNation scam and got to this page.
I am completely satisfied with InterNations.com online support. Super!
"Internations is a very useful platform particularly for new and young expats. I myself am an expat for 42 years, starting as a volunteer in development work (first in rural water supply & sanitation and later in management). My tour brought me and my family to Nepal, UK, the Netherlands, the Philippines, South Sudan, Kenya, and now I am in Bangladesh. The various Internations activities are generally pretty the same in all these countries, with regular parties, social gatherings and outings. My perception is that these activities are mainly catered for the young(er) generation of expats - (understandably, because this is the largest group of members on this platform). However, I miss at times activities or exchanges that might be interested for the more seasoned expats (and thus generally older) members. I'm thinking of possible topics and issues related to ""third-culture children"", exchange of ""cross-cultural anecdotes"" - i.e. in a light/funny way exchanging of (at times embarrassing) cross-cultural exper..."
I was very happy with the way internations handled my query about paying for services no longer being used. Thank you for your help.
"I wish I could give zero stars to this sham of an organization. All they care about is squeezing membership fees out of you, even if it means scamming people, I wonder how these scums are even allowed to thrive. I was auto-renewed for Albatross membership without a headstart. Thankfully I changed my credit cards. But these scums will haunt you with emails and threaten you with legal action if you do not pay for a service that you do not want to use any more. Their reasoning; 'your details as an Albatross member have been shared with organizers'. Excuse me, but who gives a damn about this information in 2020 when all the social events are nearly impossible????I am going to knock on every legal door I can to lodge a complaint against these scums, hope they are brought down!"
Automatic renewal of membership without warning the worst!
"These shmucks didn`t ""approve"" my membership. F UR APPROVAL - WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK U ARE?"
Internations is the worst app I've EVER used.They charge you £98 with NO WARNING!DO NOT USE THIS APP
Would be a zero star review if the system allowed. I signed up to Internations while working overseas last year. One month after the anniversary of joining I got a 'renewal reminder follow-up'. I never received any reminder ahead of the renewal - so this was already inaccurate. Their policy is to automatically renew memberships - taking payment from your card provided at signup (mine had thankfully expired). I have multiple annual payments with other organisations and without fail ALL of them act in an ethical manner and let me know before the renewal date that a payment is due. Not Internations.Despite multiple emails to them pointing out that their policy is borderline fraudulent and not in keeping with other service providers, I have only ever had generic customer service responses.Unless you really need their services I would suggest you give them a wide berth. If you do sign up, cancel your service after payment. I was told that this will mean at the one year mark you will not be charged - if it's sti...
